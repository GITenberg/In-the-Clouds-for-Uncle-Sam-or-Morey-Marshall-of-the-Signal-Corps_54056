<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a><br />
<small>AN EARLY MORNING GALLOP.</small></h2>


<p>“Hey dar, come along. What’s detainin’ yo’
all?”</p>

<p>Two boys, one, a gaunt, long-legged, barefooted
colored lad, mounted on a lean mule, and
the other a white lad, knees in and bestriding a
fat, puffing, sway-backed mare, came dashing
down a country road in Virginia.</p>

<p>“You black rascal!” panted the white rider,
“what d’you mean? Pull up!”</p>

<p>“I cain’t,” shouted the boy on the mule. “Ole
Jim’s got de bit.”</p>

<p>“Bit?” muttered the other rider, noticing the
mule’s rope halter and smiling. “I reckon Amos
wants a race.”</p>

<p>Loosening his worn and dingy reins the white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
boy drew himself together, took a fresh grip on
an old fashioned riding crop and spoke to his
mount.</p>

<p>“You ain’t goin’ to take the dust from a common
mule, are you, Betty?”</p>

<p>As if she understood, the laboring mare, already
wet with foam, and with nostrils throbbing,
sprang forward.</p>

<p>“Out of the way!” shouted her rider. His
light hair lay flat on his bare head and his arms
were close by his side. “Mules off the road for
the old hunter!”</p>

<p>Like a flash the boy on the mare passed the
plunging, clattering old Jim and his humped-up
rider. But only for a moment. Proud Betty,
once the pride of the late Colonel Aspley Marshall,
the hunter that took the dust from nothing
in western Virginia, had seen her day. Old Jim
came on like an avalanche.</p>

<p>“Cain’t stop dis beas’, Marse Morey. Git
outen de way, Marse Morey, we’s needin’ de
road.”</p>

<p>Hanging about the neck of the mule, Amos,
the colored boy, opened his mouth, flashing a
row of white teeth on Morey’s sight. The
young rider knew that Amos was laughing at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
him. He set his square jaw and leaned forward
over the old hunter’s neck.</p>

<p>“Betty,” he whispered, patting the soft,
silken coat of his laboring animal, “for the
honor of the stable we used to own—<em>go it</em>!”</p>

<p>And Betty tried—her nostrils now set, her
head and neck forward, and the light young
rider firm but easy in his seat.</p>

<p>“Can’t hold him, eh?” shouted Betty’s rider
as the mule drew alongside.</p>

<p>Amos was digging his bare heels into old
Jim’s ribbed sides and lashing like mad with
the end of his bridle rope.</p>

<p>Morey saw that he was beaten in a flat race,
but he did not surrender.</p>

<p>“Race you to the barn,” he cried as Amos’
kicks and lashing forced the plow mule once
more to the front, “and over the front gate.”</p>

<p>“No sah! No sah!” trailed back from Amos.
“Dis ain’t no fox hunt. Dis am a plain hoss
race. Not ober de gate.”</p>

<p>“The first one over the gate,” insisted the
white boy, now falling well behind.</p>

<p>Amos turned but he did not show his teeth.</p>

<p>“Look hyar, Marse Morey! What you talkin’
’bout? Dat ole Betty ain’t jumped no gate sence
you all’s pa died. Yo’ll break yo’ fool neck.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>Morey only smiled. The two animals beat the
hard highway with their flying feet.</p>

<p>“Yo’ all’s on’y jokin’, Marse Morey,”
pleaded the alarmed colored boy, as the racing
steeds came to the dirt road leading through
what was left of the Marshall estate, and headed
toward the ramshackle old gate a quarter of a
mile away. The dust rolled behind the galloping
horse and mule. Amos turned and shouted
again:</p>

<p>“Pull up dat ole plug. She cain’t jump a feed
box. Yo’ all gwine break bofe yo’ necks.”</p>

<p>The only answer was a wave of Morey’s riding
crop and a toss of the smiling boy’s head.</p>

<p>“Out of our way, boy!” sang out Morey.
“Over the gate—”</p>

<p>“Hey, Marse Morey! Hey dar! Take yo’ ole
race. I’s jes’ jokin’. I ain’t racin’ no mo’,” and
throwing himself backwards on old Jim the
frightened Amos pulled out of the race. But
Betty, the stiff and crippled old hunter, had her
mettle up, and Morey made no effort to stop
her. With a laugh and a wave of his hand at the
alarmed colored boy as he dashed by, the cool
young white lad gave the proud mare her head.</p>

<p>At the half-broken gate the trembling animal,
throwing off for a moment the stiffness of years,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
came to a mincing pause, gathered her fore feet
beneath her and rose. Up in the air went Morey’s
hands and his father’s old crop as Betty’s
fore feet cleared the top panel. Then—crash!
On the uncut grass of the door yard tumbled
horse and rider.</p>

<p>“I tol’ yo’! I tol’ yo’!” shouted Amos as Betty
struggled clumsily to her feet. “Marse Morey,”
he added, rolling from old Jim’s back, “is
yo’ hurted?”</p>

<p>There was a dash of red on the white cheek of
the prostrate Morey but in another moment he
was on his feet.</p>

<p>“I ain’t hurt, you rascal, but the next time
you turn that old plow plug loose against Betty
I’ll break your black head.”</p>

<p>“Yas sah, yas sah,” snickered Amos. “She
sho’ was gwine some!”</p>

<p>“Rub Betty down and then give her a quart of
oats.”</p>

<p>“Yo’ mean turn her in de fiel’!”</p>

<p>“Has she been fed this morning?”</p>

<p>“Dey ain’t no oats. We’s out ob oats.”</p>

<p>“Tell your father to order some.”</p>

<p>“I reckon he done ordah cawn an’ oats but
dey’s slow bringin’ ’em. Dey’s slow all de time.
I done been borrowin’ oats offen Majah Carey.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well,” exclaimed Morey proudly, “don’t
you borrow any more oats from Major Carey!”</p>

<p>“Why,” exclaimed Amos, “we been gittin’
fodder offen’ Majah Carey all winter—all de
while yo’ been to school. Dey’s so slow bringin’
oats from town dey don’t never git hyar.”</p>

<p>“Did my mother tell you to go to the Carey’s
for horse feed?”</p>

<p>“Fo’ de lan’ sake, chile! you don’ reckon my
ole pap gwine to bodder Miss Marshall ’bout
oats and cawn! He jes’ tells me to go git ’em
and I done go git ’em.”</p>

<p>A peculiar look came into the face of Amos’
young master. But Morey said nothing. Waving
his hand to the solemn-faced colored boy to
care for the animals, he started across the long,
fragrant June grass thick about the dingy plantation
home.</p>

<p>But trouble sat lightly on Morey Marshall.
Before he and the shambling Amos were many
feet apart the young Virginian paused and gave
an old familiar soft whistle. The slow-footed
colored boy stopped instantly, and then, as Betty
wandered at will into a new flower bed and
the lean mule walked with ears drooped towards
the distant horse sheds, Amos hurried to Morey’s
side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>“Amos,” said Morey, “are you busy this
morning?”</p>

<p>The colored boy looked at his white companion
in open amazement.</p>

<p>“I said,” repeated Morey, “are you <em>busy</em> this
morning?”</p>

<p>Amos was not exactly quick-witted, but, in
time, with great mental effort, he figured out
that this must be a joke.</p>

<p>A sparkle slowly came into his wide-set eyes
and then his long, hollow face grew shorter as
his cheeks rounded out. His lips parted in a
curved slit and his white teeth shone. He
laughed loudly.</p>

<p>“I reckon I’s gwine be purty busy. Ma’m
Ca’line done tole me to sarch de hen’s nes’.
On’y,” and he scratched his kinky head, “on’y
I ain’t had no time yit to git de aiggs.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll help you with that. How many
hens are there now?”</p>

<p>“Fo’. But one’s a rooster.”</p>

<p>“How many eggs do we get a day?”</p>

<p>“Ebery day two—sometimes. Des’ fo’ yo’
ma’s breakfus’.”</p>

<p>It was Morey’s turn to laugh.</p>

<p>“Pa’s done made ’rangements to lend us six
pullets from Majah Carey.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>“To borrow six hens?”</p>

<p>“Sho’. We done borrow’ chickens mos’ ob de
time—fo’ de aiggs. But we don’t keep ’em.
We always takes ’em back—mostly.”</p>

<p>“Mostly?” roared Morey.</p>

<p>“Shorely,” explained Amos soberly. “We’s
pa’ticlar ’bout dat. But we done et one of Captain
Barber’s ole hens. She was too fat an’
lazy—didn’t git us one aigg.”</p>

<p>“Was this all for my mother?” queried Morey,
his face clouding again.</p>

<p>“Yo’ ma don’ know nothin’ ’bout de critters.
Pa, he paid Captain Barber fo’ de ole hen we
et.”</p>

<p>“That’s right.”</p>

<p>“Yas sah, yas sah. I done took him a dozen
aiggs ma sef. Wha’ fo’ yo’ laffin’, boy? Da’s
right.”</p>

<p>“What I wanted to know is, have you time to
go fishing this morning? How about that trout
hole up at the bend of the creek?”</p>

<p>Amos’ smile gleamed again like a white gash.</p>

<p>“Ole Julius Cæsar, de king trout? Ain’t nobody
cotch him yit. But he’s got ’bout a million
chilluns. Say, boy,” whispered the colored lad,
“I done reckon Miss Marshall had her breakfus’
by dis’ time. An’ dem aiggs ain’t gwine to spile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
whar dey is. I’s git yo’ ol’ rod and yo’ ol’ flies,
an’ say, I’s got one dat ah made mase’f. Dat
fly’s fo’ ol’ Julius Cæsar an’ you. Say,” he
concluded, looking wisely into the clear blue unclouded
sky and wrinkling his sober brow, “I
spec’s we bes’ be gwine ’long. Pears to me like
rain.”</p>

<p>“I’ll meet you in a half hour by the tobacco
shed,” exclaimed Morey.</p>

<p>Again Amos’ brow lowered and he shook his
head.</p>

<p>“Ain’t yo’ ma tol’ you?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Told me what?”</p>

<p>“Dey ain’t no shed no mo’.”</p>

<p>“No shed!” exclaimed Morey, looking quickly
toward the far end of the old plantation.
“Why, what’s become of it?”</p>

<p>“Captain Barber, he done tote it away.”</p>

<p>“Captain Barber moved it away? Why, what
right has he on my mother’s place?”</p>

<p>“I dunno. But he tooked it away.”</p>

<p>“When?” exclaimed Morey excitedly.</p>

<p>“When?” repeated Amos. “Da’s when he
fit pa and call him ‘ol’ fashion nigger better
wake up.’”</p>

<p>Morey caught the colored boy by the shoulders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>“I didn’t know your father ever had a fight
with our neighbor.”</p>

<p>“Not ezackly no fight, kase Captain Barber
he wouldn’t do nothin’ but laugh.”</p>

<p>“But what was it all about?”</p>

<p>“Pap done call him a liar.”</p>

<p>“Your pap ought to be hided. Captain Barber
is a white man.”</p>

<p>“Yas sah, yas sah. But he <em>is</em> a liar.”</p>

<p>Morey smiled again.</p>

<p>“Do you know what he lied about?” he asked.</p>

<p>Amos drew himself up in indignation.</p>

<p>“Didn’ he go fo’ to say he bought de’ ole fiel’
whar de baccy shed was? An’ ain’t dat a big
lie? Yo’ ma owns all dis ole plantation ’case
pap says she do. But he tooked de house. He
ain’t buy dat lan’, is he?” concluded the simple
colored boy.</p>

<p>Morey stood in deep thought. But at last, his
voice quavering, he said:</p>

<p>“I don’t know, Amos—I hope not.”</p>

<p>Morey had returned home that morning after
a winter in school at Richmond and a visit to his
uncle in New York State. To him the old house
appeared much the same, and his mother was in
no wise changed. With her he had as yet had
no talk over the affairs of the plantation and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
after his morning coffee, he had hurried with
Amos to the village two miles away on an errand.
The hints that Amos had dropped unconsciously
startled him, but the sky was blue, the
air was soft, there was the smell of mint in the
neglected grass and he was but eighteen years
old.</p>

<p>“Meet me where the barn used to be,” he exclaimed
suddenly and, turning ran toward the
house.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a><br />
<small>BREAKFAST ON THE GALLERY.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Aspley Place, once the center of a large estate
and the scene of much hospitality in Colonel Aspley
Marshall’s lifetime, was now surrounded
by a farm of less than two hundred acres. Mortimer,
or “Morey” as he was always called, and
his mother, had been left dependent upon the
estate at Colonel Marshall’s death three years
before. At first it was not known that Colonel
Marshall was financially involved. But his
debts almost consumed his supposed enormous
and valuable tobacco plantation. Out of the
settlement Major Carey, his executor, saved for
the widow and her son the home. But it and the
little farm immediately about the house was
mortgaged to Major Carey himself, who from
year to year renewed the notes for borrowed
money.</p>

<p>On these few worn and almost exhausted
acres a faithful retainer, an old negro, Marshall
or “Marsh” Green, who had been Colonel Marshall’s
servant from babyhood, made desperate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
efforts to provide a living for his mistress. He
and his boy Amos Green lived in the sole remaining
cabin of the old quarters, where, in the
time of Colonel Marshall’s father and in the
days when Amos Green’s grandfather was a
boy, there had been a street of log huts beneath
big oaks, and a hundred slaves might be counted.
Marsh Green and his boy now lived in a cabin
patched with store boxes, beneath a roof mended
with flattened lard tins.</p>

<p>It was now many a day since the Marshalls
had killed their own hogs, and as for the old
oaks, Colonel Aspley himself had sold them. In
truth, Morey’s father was neither a successful
farmer nor a frugal business man. He believed
in the past, was a kind parent and husband, had
his mint juleps regularly, lived up to his patrimony
and left for Morey nothing more than the
recollection of a chivalrous and proud father, a
mortgaged plantation, old Marsh Green and fat
Betty, his hunter.</p>

<p>But these things Morey neither knew nor understood.
Mrs. Marshall had a vague belief
that what she called her “private fortune”
would amply care for her and for Morey’s education.
She neither knew the amount of this nor
her real income. In fact, this fortune, left to her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
by an uncle, was a meagre five thousand dollars,
and the $250 it produced annually, which Captain
Barber’s bank at Lee’s Court House collected
and held for her, was always overdrawn.</p>

<p>It was by Captain Barber and Major Carey
that Mrs. Marshall’s taxes were looked after,
her insurance cared for and her notes renewed
from year to year, and she lived on in dignity
and pride with little understanding of how the
money came. Nor did she even suspect how
much was due to the ceaseless efforts of Marsh
Green.</p>

<p>“Colonel Aspley’s overseer,” she always said
in referring to the faithful Green.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Marshall’s hired man,” said the newcomers
who were turning old and historic tobacco
fields into fruit orchards and vegetable
gardens.</p>

<p>But Marsh could hardly be called a “hired”
man. If he was “hired” it was without pay.
All the money that the white-haired negro saw
came from the vegetables he grew that “the
place” did not need. And these were as much
the property of old Marsh as if the plantation
were his. Mrs. Marshall did not even think of
the matter. Twice a year she and Marsh and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Amos drove to Lee’s and the colored servitors
were clothed.</p>

<p>The fall before, Morey, with much ceremony,
had been forwarded to a school for boys in Richmond,
famous both for its excellent curriculum
and its high tuition. The bills for this had been
met by Captain Barber as long as the little account
in his bank warranted. Then came the
inevitable.</p>

<p>On a day late in the winter Captain Barber
and Major Carey, freshly shaven and carrying
their gold-headed canes, drove slowly up to Aspley
Place. Mammy Ca’line received them. In
the musty old parlor, where Colonel Marshall’s
picture in his red hunting coat glared down upon
his old time friends, the nervous committee
twirled two shiny canes.</p>

<p>Mrs. Marshall was not an old woman. Her
veneration for the past was not based on any
love for long gold chains, earrings, or corkscrew
ear curls. There was something a little faded
about her appearance but it was not in her hair,
nor in her face. Perhaps it was in the gown she
wore, but this neither the Captain nor the Major
saw. Mrs. Marshall’s neighborly greeting,
her courtesy, preserved with many other graces
from the days of the old régime, her smile of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
peace and content, disconcerted the visitors.</p>

<p>“Madam,” began Major Carey at last, “theah
is a little mattah—a trifle—but, ah, a mattah
that we feel bound, Madam, to lay befoah you.”</p>

<p>“Ouah respect, Madam, foah yo’ husban’, the
late Colonel Marshall, who was ouah friend,”—added
Captain Barber.</p>

<p>“The regard we hold fo’ his memory and fo’
you and yo’ son Mortimer,”—went on the Major.</p>

<p>What they had come to say to Mrs. Marshall
was that, in her circumstances, Mortimer could
not be sent away to a fashionable school; that
he could not hope to play the role of a gentleman,
that the farm was non-productive and
should be sold, that Mortimer, now a young man,
should set about earning a living, and that she
and her son ought to purchase a cottage in the
nearby village where they might live on a reduced
scale and dispense with the unremunerated
services of old Marsh and his idle, lazy,
hungry son.</p>

<p>But no such suggestions were made.</p>

<p>Mrs. Marshall listened to the explanation of
her financial straits undisturbed. Where the
agitated visitors expected tears and despair they
found a paralyzing calmness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>“I regret to say, my dear Madam,” concluded
Major Carey at last and with a dry throat, “that
you now owe Mortimer’s school four hundred
dollars, and the bill is so long overdue that they
are, ah, becoming even impertinent.”</p>

<p>“I really thought it had been paid,” said Mrs.
Marshall in her low, soft tone and looking at her
banker, Captain Barber, in an injured way. The
Captain only wiggled in his chair. He even dismissed
the idea he had had of telling Mrs. Marshall
that she had already overdrawn her account
one hundred and eighty dollars. “Haven’t
I some funds out at interest?” continued their
hostess.</p>

<p>“I think you have about—”</p>

<p>Mrs. Marshall smiled and raised her still
plump hand.</p>

<p>“Please don’t bother about the details,” she
added hastily. “You have always been so good
as to look after my business. I will take it as a
favor if you will realize out of my funds whatever
is needed to cover this obligation. I prefer
to sacrifice my private fortune rather than
encumber the family estate which, of course,”
and she smiled comfortably, “is to be preserved
for Mortimer.”</p>

<p>The two visitors could not look at each other.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
They sat silent and aghast. The “family estate”
had been reduced to less than two hundred
acres of worn out and almost unsalable tobacco
land. Even this was mortgaged and Major Carey
had been carrying the obligation for years.
He had not even received a cent of interest since
Colonel Marshall’s death.</p>

<p>“Certainly, Madam,” stammered Captain
Barber at last, rising. “Just as you wish.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Marshall,” said Major Carey bowing,
“when Master Mortimer returns from school
will you have him do me the honor to call upon
me?”</p>

<p>“With great pleasure,” said Mortimer’s
mother, “although the poor boy is not coming
directly home at the close of school. He will
first visit his uncle Douglas in Hammondsport,
New York. And, by the way, Captain,” she
added, turning to the flustered planter-banker,
“I’m afraid his wardrobe may require replenishing
and he will need a little pocket money.
Will you kindly send him a hundred dollars and
charge it to my account?”</p>

<p>There was no help for it. If she had been a
man the thrifty banker would have been adamant.
To the widow of his dead friend he only
bowed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>“At once,” he answered politely. Then he
added: “Madam, I trust you will not think me
impertinent. But what are your plans for your
son’s future?”</p>

<p>“Colonel Marshall was a tobacco grower,”
she answered proudly. “The Aspley plantation
has known nothing but tobacco for a hundred
and fifty years.”</p>

<p>When Major Carey’s old buggy—he did not
own or use an automobile—had creaked down
the weed-grown Aspley Place private road to
the highway and the unhinged gate had been
dragged into place, Captain Barber turned to
his companion.</p>

<p>“If Mrs. Marshall’s son hasn’t any more business
sense than his mother the Barber Bank is
going to have a tidy sum to charge up to profit
and loss. We’re two old fools. What do you
want to see the boy about?”</p>

<p>Major Carey grunted. “I’m goin’ to tell him
what his mother doesn’t know—that she isn’t
worth a cent and that he must go to work and
care for her.”</p>

<p>This was in March.</p>

<p>On the day in June that Morey reached his
home, raced with Amos, arranged to go in quest
of “old Julius Cæsar” and his many “chilluns,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
and then made his way free-hearted and devoid
of care over the unkempt lawn toward the house,
there was no thought in his mind of money, debts
and little of the future.</p>

<p>“Aspley House” hardly merited such a formal
title. The building itself was of wood, two
stories high and long since denuded of paint.
But the gallery, or porch, in front seemed part
of some other architectural creation. The floor
of it was flush with the yard and of brick, worn
and with sections missing here and there. The
columns, unencumbered with a second story
floor, were of great round pillars of brick. They
had once been covered with cement, but this
coating had now fallen away and the soft red
of the weather beaten bricks was almost covered
with entwined swaying masses of honeysuckle.</p>

<p>Beneath these blossoming vines Morey’s
mother awaited him.</p>

<p>“I saw it,” she exclaimed anxiously. “I’ve
seen your poor father do the same. You are not
hurt?”</p>

<p>“Hurt?” shouted Morey as his mother put
her arm about his neck and wiped the blood from
his face with her lace handkerchief. “I’ve forgotten
it. Breakfast ready?”</p>

<p>In a fragrant, shaded corner of the gallery,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
where the brick pavement was reasonably intact,
sat a little table. On the snow-white cloth
rested a bowl of flowers. At two places thin,
worn silver knives, forks and spoons glistened
with a new polish. But the “M” had nearly
disappeared from them.</p>

<p>“Say, mater,” laughed Morey, proud of his
newly acquired Latin, “why don’t you fix this
pavement? Some one’s going to break his neck
on these broken bricks.”</p>

<p>“It should have been seen to before this,”
his mother answered. “And I really believe we
ought to paint the house.”</p>

<p>“Looks like a barn,” commented Morey, attacking
a plate of Mammy Ca’line’s corn bread.
“This some of our own butter?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Marshall looked up at the fat smiling
Mammy Ca’line, beaming in her red bandanna.</p>

<p>“Mammy,” asked Mrs. Marshall, “is this
some of our own butter?”</p>

<p>“Ouah own buttah!” exclaimed the grinning
cook, maid and all-around servant. “Fo’ the
lans’ sake, Miss Marshall, we ain’t made no buttah
on dis place sense ole Marse done gone, fo’
yars come dis fall.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Marshall sighed.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you?” snapped Morey with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
tone that reminded his mother of his dead
father.</p>

<p>“Why don’t we?” laughed old Ca’line. “I
reckon you boun’ to have cows to make buttah—leastways
<em>a</em> cow. Dat ole Ma’sh Green don’
keep no cows no mo’.”</p>

<p>Morey laughed.</p>

<p>“Runnin’ on the cheaps, eh?”</p>

<p>But his mother only smiled and sipped her
coffee.</p>

<p>As the hungry, happy boy helped himself to
one of the three thin slices of bacon, old Ca’line
leaned toward her mistress and said, in a low
voice:</p>

<p>“Miss Ma’shall, dat’s de lastest of dat two
poun’ of salt meat.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Marshall smiled again.</p>

<p>“Have the overseer go to town this morning,
Ca’line, and lay in what supplies are needed.
Have we any fowls on the place?”</p>

<p>“Yas ’um, dey’s fowls, but dey’s only
‘aiggers.’ Dey ain’t ‘eaters.’”</p>

<p>As Mrs. Marshall looked up in surprise, Morey
experienced the first serious moment of his
life.</p>

<p>“It’s one of Amos’ jokes, mater. I understand.
I’ll tell you about it after a bit.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>“Amos is really very trying at times,” was
Mrs. Marshall’s only comment.</p>

<p>“As for meat, Ca’line,” went on Morey gaily,
“don’t bother. Amos and I are going for trout
this morning. We’ll have a fish dinner today.”</p>

<p>“Your father was very fond of trout,” exclaimed
Morey’s mother. “I’m so glad you’re
going. By the way, Mortimer, the first day you
find the time Major Carey wants you to call.
He’s very fond of you.” Then, thoughtfully,
“Have you any engagement this evening? We
might drive over late today.”</p>

<p>“That’s a go,” exclaimed Morey, springing
up, “unless the fishing makes me too late. Pleasure
before business, you know.”</p>

<p>As old Ca’line shambled down the wide hall
she shook her head and mumbled:</p>

<p>“His pappy’s own chile! An’ dat’s what took
de paint offen dis house.”</p>

<small>MOREY MEETS A FELLOW FISHERMAN.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Mrs. Marshall’s home fronted the west. Always,
in the distance, like a magic curtain ready
to rise and reveal a fairyland beyond, hung the
vapory Blue Mountains. Round about, like long
fingers, the rough mountain heights ran down
among the century-old plantations. Ridges,
pine-grown and rocky, and here and there tumbling
rivulets gave variety to the long, level
reaches of tobacco land.</p>

<p>A little creek, finally trickling into the north
part of the Rappahannock river, skirted what
had once been the east boundary of the old Marshall
plantation. In days long gone, before the
forests thinned and while the mountain sides
were thick with laurel, ash, and oak, the creek
plunged lustily in and out of its wide and deep
pools and went bounding musically in many a
rapid. But now, even as the Marshall acres had
thinned and disappeared, the woodland stream
had dwarfed and shrunk until it was little more
than a reminder of its former vigor.</p>

<p>Yet, by all the Marshalls it was remembered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
as the place where Colonel Aspley had “whipped
the stream for speckled beauties” like a gentleman;
it was still Aspley Creek, and Amos was
not the only one who believed trout might still
be taken there. It was not surprising, therefore,
that Lieutenant Fred Purcell, of the U. S. Army,
should on this day drive twenty miles from Linden
to try his luck there.</p>

<p>Why this keen-eyed young officer, and many
other soldiers who were not officers, were seen
so often in the little railroad town of Linden,
few persons knew. But to this place he had
come, when the snows in the mountains were
disappearing in March, with a few brother officers
and a squad of privates and much strange
baggage. Mules and wagons followed a few
days later and then the new arrivals disappeared.
There were many theories. Generally
it was agreed that it might mean an expedition
against “moonshiners” or illicit distillers.
More conservative gossips predicted that it was
a party of military engineers. The local paper
ventured that the war department was about to
locate a weather observatory on the mountains.
One thing only became, gradually, common
knowledge—that the soldiers were in camp near
Green Springs, in Squirrel Gap, ten miles back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
in the foot hills and that the officers came every
few days to the Green Tree Inn, in Linden, to
eat and smoke.</p>

<p>Morey, rising from the breakfast table, was
almost on Mammy Ca’line’s heels.</p>

<p>“Mammy,” he shouted, “where’s my old
fishin’ clothes?”</p>

<p>The fat old negress turned and then, embarrassed,
exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Yo’ ma done say yo’ don’ want dem ol’
pants no mo’. She gib all yo’ ol’ garmen’s to
Amos.”</p>

<p>“Everything?” laughed Morey, looking down
at his second best trousers. “I’m goin’ for
trout. I can’t wade in these.”</p>

<p>Old Ca’line shook her head.</p>

<p>“I reckon yo’ ma gwine get yo’ new clothes.
Yo’ old clothes is Amos meetin’ pants.”</p>

<p>“Amos!” yelled Morey, rushing through the
wide hall and out into the rear yard. “Amos!”
he called, hurrying toward the tumble-down
cabin of the Greens. “Gimme my pants! My
fishin’ pants!”</p>

<p>The sober-faced colored boy was just emerging
from the single room in which he and his
father lived, with a bit of clothes line around
his shoulders to which was attached an old,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
cracked, and broken creel, and carrying in his
hand a long-preserved jointed casting rod.</p>

<p>“I say,” repeated Morey, half laughing,
“Mammy Ca’line says Mother gave you my old
fishing clothes. Produce—I want ’em.”</p>

<p>The colored boy looked up, alarmed.</p>

<p>“Ah—ah,” he stuttered. “Dem’s my own
clothes. Dey’s my onliest meetin’ pants.”</p>

<p>“I should say not,” roared Morey. “Mother
didn’t know what she was doin’. Fork ’em
over! I can’t go into the water in these,” he
added, pointing to the trousers he had on.
“These ain’t <em>ready-made</em>,” he went on proudly;
“they ain’t boughten. I got them from a tailor
in Richmond.”</p>

<p>Amos eyed the new trousers with interest
and admiration. Then his lip quivered.</p>

<p>“Marse Morey,” he whimpered, “yo’ ma
done gib me dem pants las’ Chrismus’. I
speck’s she don’t ’low I’s gwine part wid dem.
Dey’s a present.”</p>

<p>“Look here, boy, don’t make me mad,” retorted
Morey. “Turn over my pants or we
don’t go fishin’.”</p>

<p>Amos’ whine ended in a sob. He hesitated
and then broke out: “Yo’ ma <em>gib</em> ’em to me.
But—.” His voice dropped to a whisper.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
“Marse Morey,” he said, coming close to the
frowning white boy, “I’s got fo’ bits I made
pickin’ berries fo’ Miss Carey—”</p>

<p>Morey’s voice did not change but a smile
seemed to hover about his clean-cut lips.</p>

<p>“Look here, nigger,” he exclaimed suddenly,
“do you want those pants worse than I do?”</p>

<p>“Wuss!” whimpered Amos. “I jes’ nachally
got to hab ’em. I done promised dem
pants to Miss ’Mandy Hill.”</p>

<p>“Promised my pants to a girl?”</p>

<p>“Yas sah,” explained Amos soberly.
“’Mandy and me’s gwine to de camp meetin’
Sunday to the Co’t House. I promise her long
time ago I’s gwine wear dem pants when we
does.”</p>

<p>“Ah, I see,” laughed Morey at last, “well,
don’t disappoint ’Mandy.”</p>

<p>When the two boys left the cabin and cut
across the old tobacco field it would have been
hard to tell which was the raggedest, Amos with
his patched blue overalls, almost white from
constant washing, or Morey clad in old Marsh
Green’s working corduroys.</p>

<p>At the ruins of the old tobacco shed Amos
paused, looked at Morey a little sheepishly and
then, from under a few protecting boards, drew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
out an old torn seine about five feet long, attached
to two thin saplings.</p>

<p>Morey’s face flushed at once.</p>

<p>“What you doing with that seine, Amos?” he
exclaimed severely.</p>

<p>“What I doin’ wid dat?”</p>

<p>“You’ve been seining trout, you black rascal.”</p>

<p>“Cross my h’at, no sah. Deed I ain’t. No
sah.”</p>

<p>“What have you been doing with it?”</p>

<p>“Well sah, some says dey is and some says
dey ain’t. But, ef yo’ ain’t no salt meat, suckers
is good eatin’.”</p>

<p>“Suckers!” snorted Morey. “You all ain’t
been seinin’ and eatin’ suckers?”</p>

<p>Amos nodded his head.</p>

<p>“You never eat none o’ Mammy Ca’line’s
sucker chowder?”</p>

<p>Morey turned up his nose in disgust.</p>

<p>“Can’t mostly tell no difference ’tween Ca’line’s
chowder and reg’lar fish,” the black boy
went on appealingly.</p>

<p>As they neared the creek Morey said:</p>

<p>“Amos, if I ever catch you takin’ a trout with
that net I’ll thrash you.”</p>

<p>As Morey went on and the tall colored boy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
looked down on his slender companion, his hollow,
mournful cheeks rounded into what was
almost a smile and he muttered to himself:</p>

<p>“I reckon dat boy been livin’ high and mighty
down to Richmond. Suckers is gittin’ ’tas’ good
to me sence Marse Aspley gone.”</p>

<p>Morey left the tobacco field and took the old
meadow path to the big bend above—Julius
Cæsar’s domain and the best part of the creek.
Amos took the road to the ford, two bends below
and about an hour’s fishing from the big pool.
If Julius Cæsar existed outside of Amos’ head
Morey could not prove it. With what skill he
had he fished the pool, waited ten minutes and
went over the same water again without a
strike. Then he advanced slowly down stream.
In three quarters of an hour only two trout did
he hook, neither of them a fish to be proud of.</p>

<p>When he reached the ford where Amos should
have been waiting for him there was no sign of
the colored boy and the sun was high overhead.
Ten minutes later, wading softly down the cool
and shady little stream and almost lost in the
sportsman’s absorption, his fly shooting forward
swiftly and silently over each eddy and
likely log, he was suddenly aroused by a quick
splash and a violent exclamation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32-<br />33]</a></span></p>

<p>Just before him, and struggling in the middle
of the stream, were two persons. <a href="#image02">Amos</a>, who
was one of them, almost prostrate in the shallow
water, <a href="#image02">was struggling to free himself</a> from the
grip of a man about thirty-five years old.</p>

<p>“You black rascal,” exclaimed the man.
“What d’you mean. Seinin’, eh? Take that!”</p>

<p>At the word he planted the flat of his hand on
the black boy’s back. As Amos fell flat in the
stream and rolled over in the water there was a
splashing behind his assailant. The man turned
just in time to see Morey, his ragged, baggy
trousers wet and impeding his progress, plugging
furiously forward.</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re his pal, eh?” laughed the man.
“Well, come on and get the same. I’ll teach
you young whelps to know better. I’ll—.”</p>

<p>But he neither had time to administer the
same nor to finish his speech. The agile Amos
with the water running from his clothes and
mouth, had recovered himself and with head
down lunged forward. The next instant both
boy and man were locked together and almost
submerged in the sluggish current.</p>

<p>As they rolled over and over Morey made desperate
efforts to stop the struggle. But he only
complicated matters. Slipping, he fell upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
two combatants. Cold water, however, is a
great cooler of angry passions. Without knowing
just how it happened, in a moment, the man
and the two boys were standing in mid-stream,
sputtering and gasping for breath. Morey still
gripped his rod, the man was glancing dejectedly
toward his own broken pole, now well down
the creek and Amos was gripping a moss-covered
rock dug up from the bed of the creek.</p>

<p>“I suppose you know you are trespassing on
private property?” began Morey, forgetting,
in his indignation, that the creek no longer was
a part of his mother’s plantation.</p>

<p>The man, shaking himself, turned as if surprised.</p>

<p>“This boy is my servant. Have you any explanation
to make?”</p>

<p>The man’s surprise increased to astonishment.
After another look at Morey’s ragged
garments he fixed his eyes upon the lad’s face.</p>

<p>“He was seining trout—” began the stranger
indignantly.</p>

<p>“Da’s a lie,” exclaimed Amos.</p>

<p>“He was fishing for suckers,” explained
Morey.</p>

<p>“Look in his pockets,” retorted the stranger.</p>

<p>Morey hesitated a moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>“My name is Mortimer Marshall, sir, of Aspley
Place. This boy is my mother’s servant.
He—”</p>

<p>At that moment Morey saw a suspicious
movement of Amos’ hand.</p>

<p>“Amos,” he exclaimed sternly, “come here!”</p>

<p>Slowly the black boy splashed forward, the
rock still in his hand, but with one cautious eye
on the stranger.</p>

<p>Morey ran his hand into the colored boy’s
pocket and drew slowly forth a still flopping
three-quarter pound trout.</p>

<p>“Fo’ de lan’s sake, Marse Morey, who done
put dat fish in dar?”</p>

<p>The man did not smile.</p>

<p>“I’m really sorry, my boy, that I struck you.
I’m a great lover of this sport and I lost my
head. I apologize to you. And to you,” he
added, turning to Morey.</p>

<p>Morey turned again to Amos.</p>

<p>“Where did you get that trout, Amos?”</p>

<p>“Cross my ha’t, Marse Morey, I reckon dat
fish done swum in ma’ pocket. Trouts is cute
fishes.”</p>

<p>Morey picked up Amos’ seine, still tangled
among the rocks, and grasping the rotten sticks
to which it was attached, he broke them over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
his knee. Then he pointed to the bank and
Amos crawled dejectedly ashore.</p>

<p>“My name is Purcell, Lieutenant Purcell, of
the United States Army,” said the stranger.</p>

<p>“I am glad to know you,” replied Morey
reaching out his hand. “I am fond of fishing
myself.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a><br />
<small>A SECRET AMBITION REVEALED.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>As Lieutenant Purcell and Morey clambered
out on the bank the military man began laughing
heartily.</p>

<p>“I suppose they are a pretty wide fit,” remarked
Morey holding out Marsh Green’s
loosely hanging trousers with one hand.</p>

<p>“I was laughing at my mistake in thinking
you were a ‘pot’ fisher,” explained the soldier.
“But I’d known if I had seen your rod—it’s a
beauty.”</p>

<p>Morey handed Lieutenant Purcell his father’s
old split bamboo, silver ferruled, and colored a
rich brown from long use.</p>

<p>“Since we caused you to lose your own rod
I want you to take mine,” said Morey promptly.
“It is a little heavy and old-fashioned but it has
landed many a fine fish. It was my father’s.”</p>

<p>“Your father is dead?”</p>

<p>“Yes sir. My mother lives—Aspley Place is
our home.”</p>

<p>“Well, I want to shake hands with you, sir,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
and to say again I am heartily sorry I lost my
head. Losing my rod serves me right. I
couldn’t think of taking yours. It’s a beauty,”
he added, taking the rod in his hands.</p>

<p>“But I want you to,” exclaimed Morey. “My
father was a sportsman. He loved his horse,
rod and gun. I don’t know what Amos meant.
I reckon it’s the first time a trout was ever taken
out of Aspley Creek in a net. I’ll feel better if
you’ll take the rod. If you don’t,” he added,
his eyes snapping, “I’ll take it and break it over
that nigger’s back.”</p>

<p>Amos, skulking within earshot—the rock still
in his hand—hurried away among the pines.</p>

<p>“I insist that the fault was all mine. But
I’ll compromise. I am stationed near Linden,
some miles from here, on special duty. It was
a long drive over here and a man will be waiting
for me some miles down the stream. I’d
like to fish the creek down to my rendezvous.
If you lend me your rod I’ll send it to you tomorrow.”</p>

<p>“At least,” said Morey, giving ready assent,
“you will consider yourself as having at all
times, for yourself and friends, the use of the
creek. And when you are nearby,” he continued,
pointing among the trees toward the west,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
“my mother will be glad to have you call at
our home. A real fisherman will always find a
welcome there. I’ve got better pants at home,”
laughed Morey.</p>

<p>The soldier shrugged his shoulders and
laughed in turn. Then he lifted the lid of Morey’s
broken creel and saw the two small trout.
In turn he exposed his own catch—seven beautiful
fish, one weighing at least a pound and a
quarter. Before Morey could stop him the lieutenant
had dumped his own string into the boy’s
basket.</p>

<p>“With my compliments to your mother, my
boy.”</p>

<p>The pride of the Marshalls rose in the water-soaked,
ragged boy’s heart.</p>

<p>“On one condition, sir; that you will take dinner
with us this evening.”</p>

<p>The man hesitated.</p>

<p>“Not today, thank you. I’m deuced glad to
meet a son of one of our old families—I’m a Virginian
myself—but, not today.”</p>

<p>“You are stationed at Linden, you say?”</p>

<p>“For a time. I may leave any day. If I do I
hope we may meet again. Won’t you take my
card?”</p>

<p>He handed Morey a card reading: “Lieutenant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
Fred Purcell, U. S. Signal Corps, Fort
Meyer, Virginia.”</p>

<p>“It will be a favor to me if you’ll take the
rod,” insisted Morey.</p>

<p>“The obligation is all mine,” insisted the
stranger. “And, if we meet again I hope I can
find opportunity to return the favor in some
way.”</p>

<p>When the two finally parted company Morey
had little reason to suspect how much that statement
meant, nor how soon he was to avail himself
of Lieutenant Purcell’s kind offices.</p>

<p>A half hour later Morey reached his home and
entered the musty, quiet horse lot. There was
hardly a breath of air and the sun lay on the
place with almost midsummer heat. A few
chickens pecked in silence but no other living
thing was in sight. Until then the boy had not
realized how desolate and run-down was the
place where once the activities of a busy plantation
centered. There were hardly signs even,
of the farm implements that had rotted away for
years. The yard seemed abandoned.</p>

<p>With a little lump in his throat the boy hurried
forward, his long, ragged trousers gathering
new dust and weight as he did do. As he
climbed the broken-down fence and got a view<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
of the big, paintless, loose-boarded house beyond
he almost sighed. But there at least were flowers
and he could hear the hum of bees among the
hollyhocks by the garden fence. There he could
see Marsh, his old hat well down on his
head, bent over his hoe, as the colored man rose
at times among the rank weeds. Beyond the
garden patch, in the low meadow, he could see,
too, old Betty and Jim the mule. Amos was not
in sight.</p>

<p>“Old Marsh is getting pretty careless,” said
Morey to himself. “There’s a good many
things he ought to do around here. Lazy niggers,”
he mused.</p>

<p>It did not occur to Morey that he might do
some of these things himself. Such had not
been the lad’s training. With another sigh
he made his way to Marsh Green’s cabin.
Never before had it looked so poor and desolate.</p>

<p>“Marsh ought to fix up his old place,” Morey
muttered. Then he turned and looked at
the big house. The wide shingles, green with
moss, were missing in many places. The big
chimney, with one side of the top missing, stood
like a monument to the departed glories of other
days. On the grey-green roof a few chimney<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
bricks lay where they had fallen. But, around
the far corner where the gallery showed, the
honeysuckle, crawling over the columns and
roof, hung a deep green curtain of new fragrance.
And, through the crookedly hanging
shutters which were the color of dead grass, he
saw fresh white curtains.</p>

<p>For the first time in his life the sight of the
bricks on the roof annoyed Morey. With a
sharp reprimand on his tongue he was about to
call to the busy Marsh when a sound fell upon
his ear. There was some one in the cabin.
Stealing around behind the crumbling shack
Morey cautiously approached it and peered
through a crack. Amos, crooning to himself,
was standing in the middle of the hard, clay floor
with Morey’s Richmond trousers held up, before
him in his outstretched hands.</p>

<p>Amos’ eyes were set. On his solemn black
face there was a look of longing. His temptation
was too great. Squatting on the floor the
colored boy emptied the contents of the trousers’
pockets on the clay; seventy-five cents in
money—dimes, nickels and a shining quarter—Morey’s
key ring, a silver pencil case, note-book,
handkerchief, rubber eraser and his new pocket
knife, the last thing he had bought in Richmond.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>Each thing the colored lad fondled, felt and
smelled. Then he opened the knife, tested it
and held it off at arm’s length. Gradually he
returned each object to its place, the knife last
of all. He sprang to his feet, and Morey was
just about to call out, but stopped. The black
boy, giving way to temptation, plunged his hand
again into a pocket of the trousers and pulled
out the new knife. He shoved the knife into his
own pocket and dropped the trousers where
Morey had left them.</p>

<p>Chuckling to himself, Morey, a few moments
later, sauntered into the cabin.</p>

<p>“Amos,” said Morey, “did that man hurt you
when he pushed you over?”</p>

<p>“Push me?” said Amos. “He done hit me
wid his fis’.”</p>

<p>“Did he hurt you?” persisted Morey, doffing
Marsh’s unwieldly trousers.</p>

<p>For answer Amos produced and exhibited the
mossy boulder that he had carried from the
creek.</p>

<p>“Don’ mak no diffunce ’bout dat. But ef dat
man ebber comes dis way,” and he shook his
head belligerently, “yo’ don’ need ast him no
sich quesson. He ain’t gwine to be hurted—he
gwine to be kilt—da’s right.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>“Anyway don’t stab him,” said Morey putting
on his own trousers.</p>

<p>“I ain’t no stabbin’ colored boy,” began
Amos with dignity, “an’ I ain’t gwine hit no
pusson when he ain’t lookin!”</p>

<p>“Good. Never do any thing behind another
man’s back.”</p>

<p>The colored boy shifted a little uneasily but
Morey only laughed and said no more. As the
two boys passed out of the cabin Morey pointed
to the distant home.</p>

<p>“Amos,” he said, “why don’t you get up
there and take those bricks down?”</p>

<p>“Yo’ ma don’ tell me to take no bricks down.
How I gwine to git ’way up dar? ’Sides, I ain’t
got no time—.”</p>

<p>“Well, I tell you—”</p>

<p>“Miss Marshall, don’ tell me—.”</p>

<p>“Git, boy!” snapped Morey nodding toward
the house.</p>

<p>But Amos hung back, digging his toes into the
dust, with a defiant look on his face. Morey began
to feel in his pockets and his face assumed
a puzzled look.</p>

<p>“I reckon I must have dropped my new knife
in the cabin,” said Morey, turning back.</p>

<p>There was a swift pat-pat of bare feet and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
as Morey glanced over his shoulder he saw Amos
in a cloud of dust loping at the top of his speed
toward the house.</p>

<p>Morey followed the flying colored boy who in
a few minutes was scrambling up the kitchen
roof. Mammy Ca’line was in the kitchen ironing
and singing softly to herself. Throwing
the now stiff trout on a table Morey said:</p>

<p>“Here you are, Mammy, trout for supper.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t you all gwine to Major Carey’s dis
ebenin’?”</p>

<p>Morey’s jaw fell. He had forgotten about the
proposed call.</p>

<p>“Anyway,” he said, “we aren’t going there
for supper.”</p>

<p>“Wha’ fo’ yo’ gwine den? Yo’ ma’ she always
stay fo’ eatin’.”</p>

<p>“Where is mother?” asked Morey.</p>

<p>“Sh! sh!” whispered Mammy Ca’line, “yo
ma been gettin’ her beauty sleep, chile.”</p>

<p>“You cook the fish, Mammy; we’ll go after
supper.”</p>

<p>The old colored woman looked up with a
shrewd smile.</p>

<p>“Yo’ all bettah go ’long to Major Carey’s tomorrow,
lessen yo’ git ’nother mess o’ fish.
Major Carey ain’t gwine to turn no one way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
from de table. De Carey’s has fish when dey
wants dem. We all has ’em when we kin get
’em.”</p>

<p>Morey grew thoughtful. But, passing on into
the hall he made his way lightly upstairs, that
he might not disturb his mother, and entered his
own little room.</p>

<p>It certainly looked restful, after his day’s
activity, and throwing himself on the big, high-posted
bed, he prepared to rest. But Morey
was not used to passing the daylight hours thus
and in a few minutes he was up and busy. His
unpacked trunk was before him and he squatted
on the floor beside it.</p>

<p>About five o’clock Mrs. Marshall, fresh and
smiling, dressed in white and with a spray of
honeysuckle in her dress, softly opened the door.
On the floor, fast asleep, lay Morey. About him,
in the direst confusion and disorder, were books,
circulars, catalogues and newspaper clippings.
The floor was littered with what had apparently
been the principal contents of the boy’s trunk.</p>

<p>Mrs. Marshall picked her way among them;
automobile catalogues, price list of motors, advertisements
of balloon manufacturers, descriptions
of aeroplane and dirigible balloon motors;
newspaper clippings relating to airships and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
their flights; motor-boat pictures. By the unconscious
boy’s arm lay a paper backed volume,
“Aeroplanes; their Manufacture and Use.”
Not less than fifty such items constituted the
litter on the floor.</p>

<p>Mrs. Marshall touched Morey on the forehead.
He sprang up, rubbed his eyes and yawned.</p>

<p>“Is this your school library?” asked his
mother, laughing.</p>

<p>“Some of it,” answered Morey soberly. “I
borrowed the rest.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Marshall looked surprised.</p>

<p>“Does this interest you?” she went on, picking
up a picture of a revolving gyroscopic motor
as if it were dynamite.</p>

<p>“Interest me?” exclaimed Morey. “I reckon
it interests any one in my business.”</p>

<p>“Your business?”</p>

<p>“Surely. That’s what I’m goin’ to be.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Marshall could only look at him, dazed
and bewildered.</p>

<p>“Haven’t had time to tell you,” smiled Morey.
“I’m an aviator. I’m going to make an
aeroplane this summer.”</p>

<small>A VISIT OF CEREMONY.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“You don’t mean to tell me you don’t know
what ‘aeroplane’ means?” almost shouted Morey,
when he saw from his mother’s look that
she was puzzled. “Well, I’ll be—”</p>

<p>“Mortimer!” exclaimed Mrs. Marshall with
as much sternness as she ever used.</p>

<p>“Mater,” he laughed, “you certainly are behind
the times.”</p>

<p>“What does it mean?” she asked placidly.</p>

<p>“I suppose you never heard of ‘aviator’
either?”</p>

<p>“I’ve heard of ‘aviary’. I believe that has
something to do with birds.”</p>

<p>“Right! Though I never heard of an aviary,”
added Morey, partly to himself. “It <em>is</em>
a bird. It’s a human bird. An ‘aviator’ is a
man who drives an aeroplane.”</p>

<p>“And this—this airy—?”</p>

<p>“Mother, sit down,” answered Morey in despair,
“and I’ll begin your aeronautical education.”</p>

<p>For the next quarter of an hour Mrs. Marshall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
dodged and parried verbal volleys of airship
talk. Beginning with hot air balloons Morey
led his mother along through a history of
aeronautics until he came to aeroplanes. And
then, not satisfied with the bewildered condition
of his patient parent, he began with the dreams
of the enthusiast.</p>

<p>“In war and peace, in commerce and pleasure,
from the Pole to the tropics, these human birds
will darken the air on pinions swifter than the
eagle’s wing. The snow-crested peaks of the
Himalayas, the deepest recesses of the tropic
wilderness, the uncharted main and the untrodden
ice of the hidden Poles will unroll before
the daring aviator like the—like—the—”</p>

<p>“The pictured pleasures of the panorama,”
continued his mother, pointing to the underscored
page of the “History of Aeroplanes”
which she had been holding during Morey’s discourse.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Morey, blushing, and then recovering
himself. “Anyway, that’s my plan of
a career. I’m going to be an ‘aviator’. And
I’m going to begin at the bottom. I’m going to
start by making an aeroplane right here—out in
the old carpenter shop.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mortimer, I suppose I am just a little behind
the times. Is this a desirable thing?”</p>

<p>“Beats the world.”</p>

<p>“Have you been studying this at school?”</p>

<p>“’Taint in the course, but everybody’s studying
it.”</p>

<p>“When did you interest yourself in such a peculiar
subject?”</p>

<p>“Oh, ages ago—long before Christmas,” answered
Morey. “I’ve read all the books in the
public library at Richmond and all the magazines,
and I’ve got all the circulars I could find.
All I want now is a set of tools and some spruce
lumber and some silk and an engine—I can do
it. Needn’t fear I can’t.”</p>

<p>“And these things,” suggested Mrs. Marshall,
her smooth brow wrinkling just a trifle,
“do they require any considerable outlay of
funds?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Morey—hesitating a little now—“The
tools won’t cost much, but I wanted to
ask you about the engine. Of course,” and he
put his arm affectionately about his mother’s
shoulders, “I know it isn’t just as if father was
with us, and I ain’t figuring on the best engine.
I would like a revolving motor, that’s the newest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
thing, one with a gyroscopic influence, but that
costs a good deal.”</p>

<p>“How much?” asked his mother taking the illustrated
price list of engines that Morey
handed her.</p>

<p>“Twelve hundred dollars.”</p>

<p>His mother gasped and the circular dropped
from her hand.</p>

<p>“I thought myself that was too much,”
quickly exclaimed Morey, puckering his lips.
“But, mater, I’m not going to be extravagant.
I’ve arranged for a cheap one, a second-hand
one. It’s at Hammondsport. I saw it when I
was visiting at Uncle’s.”</p>

<p>His mother sighed, looked for a moment out
toward the ruined and ramshackle barn and
then, with a new smile, asked indifferently:</p>

<p>“And the price of this—approximately?”</p>

<p>“This one,” answered Morey, proudly, “is a
real Curtiss six-cylinder, and it’s a regular aeroplane
engine. It’s cheap, because the man it was
made for didn’t take it. Cousin Jack knows a
boy who works in Mr. Curtiss’ shop. I saw Mr.
Curtiss about it myself. It was such a bargain
that I—I—well I bought it.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Marshall breathed a little heavily and
rearranged her dress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>“You didn’t mention the price,” she said at
last, patting Morey’s hand.</p>

<p>“Only four hundred dollars!”</p>

<p>His mother laughed nervously. “I’m afraid
my boy is a little extravagant,” she remarked
slowly.</p>

<p>“Do you know what that engine’s worth!”
exclaimed Morey. “It’s worth $800 any day.”</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose the young men of today
must have their amusements. Your father’s
was horses and hunting. But it did not interfere
with his business as a planter. I trust you
will not become extreme in the fancy. It must
not be carried too far.”</p>

<p>“Too far? I’m not going to do anything
else until I get rich.”</p>

<p>“Nothing else? You mean no other amusement?”</p>

<p>“That’s not amusement; it’s business. It’s
going to be my job.”</p>

<p>“You mean along with tobacco planting?”</p>

<p>“I should say not. What, me a farmer? Tobacco
is played out.”</p>

<p>“Mortimer Marshall!”</p>

<p>“You don’t think I’m going to be a planter,
do you?”</p>

<p>“Mortimer!” Mrs. Marshall was erect in her
chair, her cheeks pale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, mater, I had no idea that you felt that
way. You don’t mean that I’m to come back
here and take old Marsh Green’s place. I can’t
grow tobacco. I don’t know how and I don’t
want to. Young men don’t do those things
nowadays. They get out and hustle.”</p>

<p>“Mortimer, your father was a planter from
boyhood until he died. His father was one and
his father’s father. Aspley Place has grown
tobacco for one hundred and fifty years. In
Virginia it is a gentleman’s life.”</p>

<p>“No, mater,” answered Morey in a low and
kind voice. “It was. But it isn’t now. You
love this place—so do I. But I’ve been out in
the world, a little—you haven’t. Things have
gone on all around us and we didn’t know it.
I can’t be a tobacco planter. I won’t.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Marshall’s lips trembled but she said
nothing.</p>

<p>“I’ll go to school, mater; I’ll even go to college
if you like. But then I want to go to an
engineering school. After that I’m going to
make you famous. I’m going to make the perfect
flying machine. Then we’ll move away from
this old place—”</p>

<p>“Mortimer!” quivered his mother. “From
Aspley Place? Your father’s home? Never!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
Then, with an effort, she became calm. Rising,
as if both hurt and indignant, she exclaimed:</p>

<p>“My son, I am your mother and your guardian.
I have my own plans for your future—your
father’s plans. From now you will dismiss
these ideas. I shall countermand your foolish
purchase or ask your uncle to do so. This summer
you will spend with me. You will return
to your school and then to the University.
When, in time, you graduate and are able to
do so you will return here and assume charge
of the patrimony bequeathed you by your
father. Meanwhile, Mr. Green will remain in
charge.”</p>

<p>And leaving Morey standing crestfallen
among the jumble of books and papers, his
mother walked sadly from the room.</p>

<p>It was the first time Mortimer had ever been
balked in his life. For six months he had
thought and dreamed of nothing else. His
pride was hurt, too, for to his cousin Jack, in
Hammondsport, he had outlined carefully the
exact details of his future plans. He had managed
to secure an invitation from Jack Marshall
to visit Hammondsport soon after his investigation
into aeroplane and airship affairs had revealed
to him that in that little town Inventor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
Curtiss had his motor shop and aeroplane factory
and that other balloon manufacturers and
experimenters had collected there in sufficient
numbers to make it the aeronautical center of
America. There he had seen real dirigible balloons,
had met and talked with Carl Meyers,
the oldest balloon navigator in the country, had
witnessed flights of the Curtiss aeroplane, had
gazed upon the renowned Professor Graham
Bell, had lounged for days about the mysterious
and fascinating shops and factories, and,
best of all and most unforgettable, had tasted
the joys of gliding on the kites and planes of
the various aeronautical experts.</p>

<p>Then he recalled the mocking laugh of his
uncle.</p>

<p>He was a stubborn boy, but—he did not know
whether he was a disobedient one. In all his
life he had never been tested. Flushed and sick
with disappointment he caught up his precious
books and circulars and was banging them into
the trunk when the door opened and Amos
stuck his head into the room:</p>

<p>“Marse Morey, yo’ ma says yo’ all gwine ober
to Marse Major Carey’s soon as yo’ has yo’
supper. An’ yo’s to put on yo’ bestest cloe’s
an’ slick up.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>Bang! went “Aeroplanes, their Manufacture
and Use.” It missed the colored boy’s head and
crashed against the door jamb.</p>

<p>“Here, you black rascal,” shouted Morey, red
in the face and full of anger, “come back here
and give me my knife, you thief!”</p>

<p>But the accusation was lost. Amos was on the
long stair rail shooting to the bottom like a sack
of wheat.</p>

<p>When the old-fashioned supper bell clanged
out in the hall below, Morey, white of face,
marched downstairs and into the dining room in
silence. At the humble board with Morey’s
trout, almost the only dish, on the snowy white
cloth before her, sat his mother, also pale, but
with her usual smile. A look of surprise swept
over her face as she noticed that Morey had
ignored her orders.</p>

<p>“The evening is very agreeable,” said his
mother softly. “It will be light for some time.
Major Carey has asked you to come and see
him. We are going immediately after supper.
I have ordered out the carriage.”</p>

<p>“Won’t tomorrow do?” said Morey sharply—and
then he was sorry.</p>

<p>“If you prefer,” answered his mother.
“Your trout are delicious.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll go tonight,” said Morey, ashamed
of his anger.</p>

<p>“The Careys are our oldest friends,” went
on his mother, smiling again. “I had hoped you
would look your best. When Major Carey does
me the honor to appear in our home he comes
clothed as a gentleman. He carries his gold-headed
cane. His linen is immaculate.”</p>

<p>“It won’t take me but a minute,” said Morey,
crowding back a tear of mortification but disposing
of a couple of crisp trout nevertheless.
“I’ll be ready as soon as you are.”</p>

<p>He was about to dash from the room when
he turned, hastened to his mother’s side and
kissed her on the cheek.</p>

<p>“That’s a good boy, Mortimer. I’m glad you
realize that I know best.”</p>

<p>While Morey was making his hasty toilet he
heard a creaking sound outside. Rushing to the
window he was about to break out into laughter.
Then he stopped and a little flush came into his
face. Slowly advancing along the road from the
stable lot was his mother’s carriage. It was the
old surrey that his father had once used in transporting
the hounds to the distant meets. Paintless,
its bottom gaping, its top cracked and split
and its wheels wobbling, it groaned forward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
toward the mounting block at the end of the gallery.
To it was hitched fat Betty, sleek and
shiny with rubbing. The harness used only on
such occasions, still withstood the final ravages
of time, for on one bridle blinder shone one
glittering polished silver M—old Marsh’s pride
and joy.</p>

<p>What had amused Morey was the sight of the
old servitor, “Colonel Marshall’s overseer,”
Marsh Green. His shoes were shining, and a
fresh white shirt showed resplendent beneath
his worn coat, but the old man’s chief glory was
his battered silk hat. By his side rode Amos,
splendid in his shoes and Morey’s trousers—his
“meetin’ pants.”</p>

<p>What had brought the flush to Morey’s face
was the sudden thought: “the Careys do not
come to Aspley Place in such a turnout.” And,
for the first time in his life, Morey felt ashamed
of the old home and its surroundings.</p>

<small>MOREY LEARNS HE IS A BANKRUPT.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Major Carey’s mansion in the village of Lee’s
Court House connected that old-fashioned,
white-housed settlement with the plantations
lying about the town. It was of red brick,
square and solemn, with a slate mansard roof.
In front, four gigantic white wooden columns
stood like towers. Unlike the Aspley house,
these columns—very cold in a coat of new paint—carried
an upper gallery or balcony extending
the width of the house. And at the left end
of the lower gallery a slender circular stairway,
concealed behind a trellis of green slats and
partly covered with ivy, led to the upper balcony.
Immense oak trees afforded shade in
what had once been an extensive dooryard.</p>

<p>But the village, which was not wholly asleep,
encroaching on the place, had eaten off sections
of the old yard on each side. What the Carey
home had been at one time, while tobacco growing
had been profitable and before Major Carey
had begun to devote himself to banking and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
money lending in town, might be seen from the
little windows on the roof. From this elevated
point an observer might see that the oak trees in
the yard had once extended in two long rows
half a mile from the front gallery, marking the
old plantation drive. New streets had cut
across these and only the tops of the mighty oaks
could be made out stretching through the growing
town.</p>

<p>It was almost dusk when Amos Green, stiff
in his heavy shoes, sprang from the surrey and
admitted Mrs. Marshall and her son through the
gate into the Carey grounds. Major Carey, his
wife, and Mrs. Bradner, their married daughter,
whose husband was the cashier in Captain Barber’s
bank, were sitting on an iron settee along
the driveway, near the house.</p>

<p>The arrival of Mrs. Marshall was almost sensational.
The Careys marched alongside the
“carriage” to the horse block and Major Carey
like a cavalier assisted his guests to light. Mrs.
Carey kissed her girlhood friend, and Major
Cary saluted her with a profound bow, but for
Mrs. Bradner there was but a light grasp of the
hand. The former Miss Carey had married a
man whom no one knew, a bank clerk from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
West with no other recommendation than his
sobriety and industry.</p>

<p>To Morey the call was wearisome in the extreme.
He reported on his school experiences,
carefully omitting his aeronautical studies, and
his mother exchanged with Mrs. Carey old-fashioned,
stilted gossip concerning their homes
and servants. Mrs. Bradner, in a beautifully
made tailor gown, sat quietly by. When Morey
saw how cheap his mother’s dress appeared in
comparison with Mrs. Bradner’s, the thoughts
that had troubled him all day came back again.</p>

<p>Then there were refreshments and the formality
relaxed somewhat.</p>

<p>“Major Carey,” said Mrs. Marshall suddenly,
“I really wish you would talk to Morey. I’m
afraid the boy has got some queer ideas in Richmond.
However,” and she smiled kindly
toward the somewhat embarrassed Morey, “perhaps
it is unnecessary now. He has promised
me to forget them.”</p>

<p>Major Carey smiled graciously.</p>

<p>“Well, boys will be boys, I’m afraid,” he began.
“But just what form of—well sir, what
are you up to now?” he asked, turning to Morey.</p>

<p>The boy’s embarrassment increased.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mother thinks I’m a farmer,” he said with
an attempt at a smile. “I can’t agree with her.”</p>

<p>“But,” interrupted Mrs. Marshall graciously,
“perhaps we ought not bother our friends with
these family details. Especially since Morey
now sees that he was wrong. He has agreed
with me to finish the full course at his present
school, to take a university training and then
become one of us again.”</p>

<p>“To take charge of Aspley plantation?”
asked Mrs. Carey.</p>

<p>Mrs. Marshall nodded her head with a satisfied
smile.</p>

<p>“And what had <em>you</em> planned?” exclaimed
Major Carey, who did not seem to join in Mrs.
Carey’s and Mrs. Marshall’s satisfaction.</p>

<p>“I was willing to finish my schooling,” answered
Morey soberly, “and I’ll even spend
four years in the university if my mother likes,
but I want a technical training. I want to
understand airships. I meant,” and he looked
at his mother covertly, “to become an aviator
if I couldn’t become an inventor.”</p>

<p>“You mean this new-fangled aeroplane business?”
asked Major Carey.</p>

<p>“I’m very enthusiastic over it,” went on Morey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do you know, Major, the boy actually wants
to build an aeroplane at our home this summer.
And just when I know he needs rest and recreation.”</p>

<p>Major Carey had risen and was nervously
toying with his heavy gold watch chain. Before
he could speak, Mrs. Marshall added:</p>

<p>“He has even purchased a—some machinery
of some kind—to go in it.”</p>

<p>Major Carey’s hand dropped from his cane.</p>

<p>“But he has given up the idea, you say?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Marshall waved her hand toward her
son who sat nervously twisting his hat.</p>

<p>“I’ll give it up if I have to,” said Morey,
further abashed, “but I don’t know what I’ll
do with my motor engine. I’ve ordered that
and I reckon it’s on the way.”</p>

<p>“These engines are rather expensive, are
they not?” continued the Major quizzically.</p>

<p>“Oh, that depends,” answered Morey, “a new
one is. This is a cheap one, second-hand. It
cost only four hundred dollars.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t paid for it, have you?”</p>

<p>Morey looked up, shook his head and fell to
twirling his hat again.</p>

<p>“I’m going to suggest that he countermand
the order,” said Mrs. Marshall. “It really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
seems to me a piece of extravagance. What do
you think, Major?”</p>

<p>Major Carey’s jaw had dropped and he was
looking at Mrs. Marshall and Morey as if in
deep thought. Recovering himself suddenly he
made an effort to smile and then said:</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” he muttered. “Yes, I agree with
you.”</p>

<p>“There, now,” exclaimed Mrs. Marshall in
gay humor. “You see Major Carey quite agrees
with me. If you could only persuade him,
Major, that he should follow in his father’s
steps—”</p>

<p>The banker-planter coughed and resorted to
his watch chain again.</p>

<p>“Perhaps Morey and I had better have a little
talk alone,” he answered at last.</p>

<p>“If you would be so good. Business always
hurts my head,” laughed Morey’s mother. The
old Virginian bowed again and slipped his arm
in Morey’s. Down the long brick walk they
strolled until the last iron settee was reached.
Major Carey, perspiring, had hardly seated himself
when he exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Morey, how old are you?”</p>

<p>“Eighteen, sir, last month.”</p>

<p>His companion nodded his head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>“My son, your father was my best friend.
Your mother has as fine and sweet a nature as
any woman in Rappahannock County. But she
has no more business sense than your old
Betty.”</p>

<p>Morey started in indignant surprise.</p>

<p>“And, in many ways, you resemble your
mother.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Major Carey? What
have we done?”</p>

<p>“What did you mean by ordering a four hundred
dollar steam engine?”</p>

<p>“It isn’t a steam engine; its a Curtiss gasoline.”</p>

<p>The elder waved his hand in impatience.</p>

<p>“Who is going to pay for it?”</p>

<p>Morey’s surprise turned to indignation.</p>

<p>“Perhaps that is our affair, Major Carey.”</p>

<p>“Your affair!” snorted the old man breaking
out at last. “Morey, it’s time for you to know
the truth. It’s bad enough for your mother to
fool herself. That’s her nature. But you are
almost a man. Neither you nor your mother has
the money to pay for this extravagance.”</p>

<p>“I thought”—began the boy.</p>

<p>“You have not thought right. I am your
mother’s friend. Four months ago I determined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
to tell her she was worse than penniless. She is
involved in debt. Aspley place is mortgaged—”</p>

<p>“You mean we are poor?” asked Morey, in a
quavering voice. “I don’t mean that—I know
we are poor. But that we owe people money we
can’t pay?”</p>

<p>“I tell you the truth,” went on Major Carey,
“only because you’ve got to get some sense into
your head. Your mother is heavily involved.
Your place is carrying a heavy debt. Your purchase
of an engine is worse than foolish—it is
shocking.”</p>

<p>The proud boy’s head fell on his breast.</p>

<p>“It won’t make matters easier for you to go
on this way. I can’t make it easy for you. You
make it hard yourself by not suspecting.”</p>

<p>“I’ll send word not to ship it,” said Morey,
not even yet realizing the whole truth.</p>

<p>“Don’t you understand, Morey?” Major Carey
exclaimed. “That isn’t the trouble. It’s
every thing. You can’t go to school, you can’t
take years to educate yourself. You’ve got to
go to work—now.”</p>

<p>The white-faced boy rose to his feet.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s it, is it? Well I’m not scared.
That’s what I am ready to do.”</p>

<p>“And you’ll have to give up your home.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>“Give up our home? Why?”</p>

<p>“The people who hold your father’s notes
and the mortgage are ready to foreclose and
take the place.”</p>

<p>“Give up Aspley Place?” repeated Morey,
the tears coming into his eyes.</p>

<p>His father’s old friend nodded his head
slowly and tremulously wiped his face.</p>

<p>“Major Carey,” said Morey with a throb in
his throat, “that would break Mother’s heart.
She can’t do that.”</p>

<p>“The sooner you realize that it must be, the
better for both of you.”</p>

<p>“Was there any way to prevent this?”</p>

<p>The old Major sighed.</p>

<p>“It isn’t your mother’s fault, Morey. And
it isn’t yours. It all began a long time ago.”</p>

<p>“You mean—?”</p>

<p>“Your father was not a good business man.
He was a gentleman and my friend—”</p>

<p>“We don’t have to discuss him, do we, Major
Carey?” exclaimed the boy with a new-born
glint in his eye. The flush of confusion and the
tremor of alarm seemed to have gone from Morey.</p>

<p>Major Carey was startled by the sudden
change.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>“What do you think we should do?” went on
the lad and he was beginning to feel like a young
man.</p>

<p>“Your mother has a little money of her own
that will keep her from want. I and others of
her friends believe she should give up the plantation
and rent a cottage in the village. You
must go to work and help support her.”</p>

<p>“Major Carey,” said Morey in a low voice,
“of course you know what you are saying. But
I can hardly believe it.”</p>

<p>“Morey, your mother is bankrupt.”</p>

<p>The boy bowed his head for a few moments.</p>

<p>“How did this happen?” he exclaimed suddenly.</p>

<p>“It is a long story—perhaps you are not old
enough to understand.”</p>

<p>“I’m old enough to have to understand.”</p>

<p>“It was your father. He mortgaged the plantation.
After he died your mother could not
even pay the interest on the borrowed money.”</p>

<p>“To whom do we owe this money?”</p>

<p>Major Carey moved a little uneasily.</p>

<p>“To the Barber Bank, principally.”</p>

<p>“To any one else?”</p>

<p>Again the old Virginian squirmed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>“Your mother has given me notes for unpaid
interest.”</p>

<p>“To you and Captain Barber?” repeated Morey,
sitting up and looking at the man beside
him.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And you and Captain Barber will own our
home?”</p>

<p>“It would naturally be that way.”</p>

<p>“How much do we owe you?” asked the boy
suddenly and leaning forward in the evening
gloom.</p>

<p>Major Carey coughed and arose nervously.</p>

<p>“More than you can repay, my lad. More
than I like to say.”</p>

<p>“But I’m going to pay it,” said Morey in a
desperate voice, laying his hand on the Major’s
arm to detain him. “I don’t know how, but
I’m going to do it. You think I’m a fool. I have
been. If I hadn’t been soaked full of ideas that
I got from every one around me I’d have known.
And don’t you believe I got ’em all from my
mother. I got ’em from everything and everybody
around here. But I understand now. I
might have understood long ago if I hadn’t been
living the life every one lives around here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>“Careful my boy. Remember, it is to your
friends that you owe much.”</p>

<p>“And I thank them,” retorted Morey angrily.
“To those who have loaned us money I’ll repay
every cent. How much do we owe you?”</p>

<p>“What I have told you is for your own good,”
was Major Carey’s only reply. The old Virginian’s
indignation was rising.</p>

<p>“Major Carey,” almost sobbed the boy,
“don’t take offense. But why didn’t you tell me
this long ago?”</p>

<p>“I tried to tell your mother, but it wasn’t
possible. I’m sorry she has to know.”</p>

<p>For a moment the man and the boy stood in
silence. Then Morey extended his hand and
made a brave effort to smile.</p>

<p>“We won’t tell her—not just yet—Major
Carey. Because a kid has been a fool is no sign
that he is going to keep it up. I’m game. I’m
going to be a man, and I’m going to have business
sense. I’m going to ‘get there’ and I’m
not scared. Tomorrow morning at ten o’clock
I’m coming to the bank and I want to know the
whole story.”</p>

<p>Major Carey shook his head.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid it’s too late.”</p>

<p>“Too late to know what struck you?” laughed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
Morey. “Perhaps I’ve got more brains than
you think.”</p>

<p>“At ten o’clock in the morning, then,” sighed
Major Carey.</p>

<p>“That’s the first business engagement I ever
had,” replied Morey, “and I rather like it. I’ll
be there.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a><br />
<small>AN EXCITING INTERVIEW.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Old Marsh Green was perhaps the poorest
farmer in Rappahannock County. But when it
came to facts in relation to the Marshall family
or the land it had owned, his information was
profuse and exact. When Morey knocked on his
cabin door at six o’clock the next morning and
ordered the white-haired darkey to turn out and
saddle Betty and Jim, Marsh and Amos were
more than amazed. They were confounded. No
Marshall had ever risen at such an hour within
the colored man’s recollection.</p>

<p>“Somepin gwine come frum dis,” muttered
Marsh. “Tain’t natchal.”</p>

<p>Amos was greatly relieved to find that the
early morning business did not relate to the
knife he had purloined.</p>

<p>Marsh knew no more after Morey had accomplished
his purpose. In an hour and a half the
boy and the “overseer” had ridden from one
end of the plantation to the other and across it;
not only the present one hundred and sixty-acre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
piece immediately about the “mansion,” but
east and west, north and south, over all the acres
once attached to the place. On a bit of paper
Morey made a rough chart of the land as his
father had known and cultivated it and on each,
parcel and division he set down notes concerning
the quality of the soil, when last cultivated
by the Marshalls, and its present physical
condition.</p>

<p>At nine o’clock he breakfasted with his
mother and at ten o’clock he was at the Barber
Bank in Lee’s Court House, above which Major
Carey had an office.</p>

<p>“I believe, Morey,” began Major Carey,
“after giving this problem a great deal of
thought, that the best thing to do, possibly,
would be to let my son-in-law, Mr. Bradner, take
charge of the matter.”</p>

<p>“A stranger,” exclaimed Morey.</p>

<p>“Well, you see,” explained Major Carey, “he
knows the situation and he can talk to your
mother. I confess that I can’t, and you are
rather young to undertake it. It’s a business
proposition now and he’s a business man.”</p>

<p>“We won’t talk to my mother at all. At least
not yet. And, when we do, I’ll do it. There’s no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
call to bring in an outsider. I’m ready for business.
Now what does this all mean?”</p>

<p>Major Carey sighed and pointed to a chair
on one side of a dusty, paper-littered table.</p>

<p>“It means,” began the planter money-lender,
“that your mother owes $14,092 with an additional
$800 soon due.”</p>

<p>Morey, instead of sitting down, sprang to his
feet.</p>

<p>“Why—why, we have never had all that
money.”</p>

<p>“That’s it. It began when your father was
alive. Eleven thousand of it he had. The rest
of it is interest and—”</p>

<p>“But my mother has money of her own. She
had a fortune that is hers.”</p>

<p>“So she believes,” explained Major Carey,
“but, Morey, money is an unknown quantity to
your dear mother. She had and still has $5,000.
It is safely invested and brings a revenue of
$300 a year. On that and with what little your
place has produced in the last three years you
have lived.”</p>

<p>“My schooling cost more than that.”</p>

<p>“There you have it. Captain Barber advanced
the money for your school bills.”</p>

<p>Morey’s face whitened and his lip quivered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
Then he leaned across the table, his hand shaking,
and exclaimed:</p>

<p>“And that’s what you call looking out for our
interests! How could you let me make such a
fool of myself? Do you imagine I hadn’t the
manhood to do the right thing?”</p>

<p>“I’d have told you, but, my boy, your mother
is different. She couldn’t stand it.”</p>

<p>“Yet you are willing now, when we are in
over our heads and about ready to drown, to let
a stranger tell her.”</p>

<p>“What can we do?”</p>

<p>“You can treat me like a man. Go on,” said
Morey stoutly. “Tell me what has happened.
If we are ‘all in’ I want to know just how deep
the water is. Don’t you be afraid. You’re not
talking to Mother now.”</p>

<p>Major Carey seemed almost to be saying to
himself, “I wish I were.” His restlessness increased.</p>

<p>“There are three mortgages on Aspley
Place,” he began, drawing a green box from his
old-fashioned desk. “The first one was made
to the Richmond Trust Co. and is on the big
one hundred and eighty-acre piece now in corn.
This is for $4,500. On the two sixty-acre pieces
to the north, the meadow and the tobacco<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
ground, there is a mortgage of $3,000 for money
advanced by Captain Barber. Just before your
father died I loaned him $3,750 on the one hundred
and sixty-acre home piece and the forty
acres of low land on the east next the creek.”</p>

<p>Morey’s lips were tightly set. Each new
item came like a stab; but he had his pencil
out.</p>

<p>“That’s $11,250,” he commented.</p>

<p>“These notes all draw seven per cent,” explained
the planter, rising and laying off his
coat, for the morning was warm and he was
perspiring. “That is $787.50 a year interest.
Your mother has not been in a position to meet
these payments. I have advanced this amount
annually for three years.”</p>

<p>“I must certainly thank you for that—”</p>

<p>“And took her notes, which, of course, are
morally protected by the mortgage I hold on the
home, and—”</p>

<p>“That’s $2,262.50 more,” added Morey with
a start.</p>

<p>“Then,” added Major Carey, “your mother’s
account at the bank is overdrawn $580, four
hundred of it for your Richmond bills.”</p>

<p>The boy set down the items, added them, saw
that they corresponded to the other’s total and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
turned, without speaking, to gaze out of the window
into the street below.</p>

<p>“And I reckon you all want your money,” he
said in a low voice at last.</p>

<p>“We are not pushing matters,” explained
Major Carey, “but we have all agreed that you
ought to know the real facts.”</p>

<p>“And this Richmond Trust Co. note,” broke
in Morey suddenly. “I suppose the note is due.
Perhaps they won’t renew it. I don’t know
much about these things, but they could push us,
couldn’t they? They might foreclose on the
land and take it, mightn’t they?”</p>

<p>Major Carey coughed. “That note has
passed into the hands of other parties.”</p>

<p>“Whose? Do you know?”</p>

<p>“Captain Barber’s bank.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” exclaimed Morey, “our bank? Yours
and Captain Barber’s?”</p>

<p>“Yes. But, of course, it is one of the bank’s
assets now and the directors are anxious to
get their money.”</p>

<p>“Why? Isn’t the interest enough? The security
is certainly ample.”</p>

<p>“That’s the trouble, Morey. The security
is not the best. Farm lands hereabouts have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
fallen so in value that we are calling in all loans
of that sort.”</p>

<p>“That ground is worth $100 an acre, any
way,” exclaimed Morey, glancing at the chart
he had made and the estimate he had secured
from Marsh Green.</p>

<p>“Perhaps $25, but I doubt if that could be
realized at a forced sale.”</p>

<p>Morey’s face fell.</p>

<p>“Isn’t any of it worth more than that?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid not.”</p>

<p>“Then the whole plantation isn’t worth more
than $15,000.”</p>

<p>The Major nodded his head.</p>

<p>“I reckon we are up against it,” exclaimed
Morey with a grim smile. “And I had figured
it out to be worth $60,000 any way.”</p>

<p>“Some of the old place isn’t worth $10 an
acre,” replied the planter. “The house you
can not count as worth anything.”</p>

<p>“Except to us,” broke in Morey stoutly. “To
us it’s worth just enough to make us want to
keep it.”</p>

<p>“There will be another $800 due as interest
this fall,” the elder man explained with a long
face and puckered lips, “and I don’t see how
I can advance any more money to care for it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>Morey, who had been desperately trying to
see some ray of light in the chaos of financial
gloom, had a sudden idea.</p>

<p>“This land is really ours, still, isn’t it? That
is, so long as the mortgages are not foreclosed?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” answered Major Carey, a little
nervously.</p>

<p>“How comes it then that Captain Barber
carted away our tobacco shed?”</p>

<p>“Did he do that?” began Major Carey. “Yes,
I believe he did. Well, it was in ruins. I think
he got your mother’s consent. Then there were
the taxes,” he continued, as if the thought had
just come to him. “He had advanced the money
for taxes on the tobacco land.”</p>

<p>“And the one hundred and eighty-acre corn
piece?” persisted Morey. “Marsh Green says
he was ordered off it—that Captain Barber
said it belonged to the bank.”</p>

<p>“No,” explained the Major, “not exactly
that. But old Green couldn’t farm it. He tried
it the year after your father died and the weeds
took his crop.”</p>

<p>“Who did farm it?” asked the boy, the Marshall
jaw setting itself in spite of his despair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>“We tried to look after it for your mother—the
bank.”</p>

<p>“And the bank had two years’ corn crop on
it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is, it rented it out. But crops were
poor both years. And the ground is run down.
There wasn’t much in it. We had to buy fertilizer
and pay taxes and—”</p>

<p>“Was there anything in it?”</p>

<p>Morey looked across the table at his father’s
old friend.</p>

<p>“Maybe—a little.”</p>

<p>“You have everything figured out in cents
that we owe you. Shouldn’t there have been
another column to show what you and the bank
owes us?”</p>

<p>“Do I understand, sir,” exclaimed Major
Carey indignantly, “that you are making
charges? You don’t reckon we have taken advantage
of your mother? Young man, if it
hadn’t been for our bank you’d be working at
day labor—”</p>

<p>“And I expect to,” came the quick answer.
“That’s neither here nor there. You needn’t
send Mr. Bradner to talk to my mother—you
needn’t say anything yourself. I’ll attend to
this. I never earned a dollar in my life but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
can add and subtract. You’ve been mighty good
to us, Major Carey, and I’m not going to pay
you with thanks. How long will you give me to
take up the obligations?”</p>

<p>“How long? What d’you mean?” exclaimed
Major Carey.</p>

<p>“You don’t reckon I’m going to let the Barber
Bank scoop up six hundred acres of good
Virginia dirt for $14,000 do you?” said Morey
significantly. “I don’t think my father’s old
friend would be willing to see us permit that.”</p>

<p>Major Carey sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>“All we want is our money,” exclaimed the
planter in a thick voice. “We’re entitled to
that, you know.”</p>

<p>“Certainly. But wouldn’t you rather have
the land?”</p>

<p>“That’s what I was going to suggest,”
blurted out the Major, the banker and money-lender
in him coming to the top.</p>

<p>Morey smiled.</p>

<p>“I thought so,” he remarked tartly.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” shouted the Major,
his face almost purple with sudden rage.</p>

<p>“I mean,” answered Morey coldly, “that for
$14,000 you and Captain Barber and Mr. Bradner—and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
I reckon that’s the Barber Bank—are
planning to get our plantation.”</p>

<p>Major Carey exploded:</p>

<p>“Young man, you have some high and mighty
ideas. Aspley plantation is dear at $20 an acre.
This is the return for all my generosity.”</p>

<p>“You’re getting seven per cent annually for
your generosity,” retorted the boy.</p>

<p>“Are you prepared to pay this debt?” came
from Major Carey savagely.</p>

<p>“I’ll be prepared in time,” rejoined Morey
with assurance. “Our farm isn’t worth $20 an
acre for tobacco. Perhaps it isn’t worth any
more for corn. But, you know, land can be used
for other things. It’s worth $200 an acre for
fruit. I’ll sell enough of it to pay you all and
I’ll be ready to make good when the money’s
due.”</p>

<p>Major Carey sank into a chair.</p>

<p>“And if you or Captain Barber or Mr. Bradner
have any occasion to see my mother on business
in the meantime I suggest they make a report
on the two years’ use of our one hundred
and eighty-acre corn piece. And, by the way,”
added Morey, “if my mother needs some small
amounts of money this summer I wish you
would instruct Mr. Bradner to let her have what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
she needs. You can charge it to our open corn
rent account.”</p>

<p>The perspiration was rolling from the excited
planter’s face. Leaning forward he grasped
Morey by the arm.</p>

<p>“You’re a fool,” he said huskily.</p>

<p>“So you told me last night—that I resembled
my mother.”</p>

<p>“You don’t know what you are talking about.
Who told you to say this?”</p>

<p>“The foolishness I inherited from my
mother. Good-bye!”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a><br />
<small>A CONSULTATION WITH AN ATTORNEY.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>It was one thing for Morey to announce that
he meant to take care of his mother’s debts.
It was another thing to decide just how this
promise was to be carried out. But, although
Morey had climbed the dusty, narrow stairs to
Major Carey’s office with nervous dread, he
came down with something of assurance—as far
as one could make out from the expression on
the boy’s countenance. His face was red, he
was perspiring, his hat was well back on his
mussed-up hair and he still held, absent-mindedly,
the scrap of paper on which he had been
figuring.</p>

<p>Within the entryway at the bottom of the
stairs he paused, scratched his head, took out
and counted all the money he had in the world—seventy-five
cents. Then he laughed.</p>

<p>“I only need $14,091.75 more,” he said.</p>

<p>For some moments he gazed out into the
almost silent street. On a sudden impulse he
pulled his hat down, started forward, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
reaching the sidewalk, gazed to the right and
left. Midway in the next block and over the
postoffice he saw a sign, in washed-out blue and
pale gold: “E. L. Lomax, Attorney and Counselor
At Law. Fire Insurance and Money
Loaned.”</p>

<p>He started toward it but, passing the drug
store on the corner, he entered, purchased a
sheet of paper, an envelope and a stamp and
on a greasy soda water counter wrote this note:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">Lee’s Court House, Virginia.</p>

<p class="noi">Mr. Glenn Curtiss,<br />
Hammondsport, N. Y.</p>

<p>Dear Sir.—My order of recent date concerning
the purchase of a six-cylinder aeroplane engine
is hereby countermanded. Circumstances
have arisen that force me to ask you to stop
shipment; to wit, I have no money to pay for
the engine.</p>

<p class="noic">Your obedient servant,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Mortimer Marshall</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>Sealing and stamping the note, Morey ordered
and drank a five-cent ice cream soda as
if to fortify himself, and then, dropping his letter
in the postoffice, he mounted the creaking
stairs to the office of E. L. Lomax. The door
was open, but the place was deserted. A few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
law books, a typewriter, white with dust, a box
of sawdust used as a spittoon, a stove crammed
full of paper scraps as if already prepared for
the next winter, a disarranged desk and four
walls almost completely covered with insurance
advertisements, and several brown and cracked
maps of Rappahannock County, confronted him.</p>

<p>Morey turned to leave. On the door he saw
a scrap of paper which seemed to have been
there many days. “Gone out. Back soon,” it
read. He turned, sat down and waited. An
hour went by and the lawyer did not appear.
Morey determined to make some inquiries. As
he reached the bottom of the stairs a middle-aged
man in a wide black hat and a long coat,
who was sitting in the window of the postoffice,
rose and greeted him.</p>

<p>“Did you want to see me?” the man asked.</p>

<p>“Are you Mr. Lomax?”</p>

<p>The man, who had a large quid of tobacco in
his mouth, of which there were traces on his
shirt front, carefully expectorated through a
grating on the flag stone sidewalk and waved
his hand toward the stairs, on which there were
more signs of tobacco.</p>

<p>“Well, so long, Judge,” drawled a man who
had been sitting in the same open window.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>“Are you Judge Lomax?” began Morey when
the two had reached the musty office above. In
the vague roster of the town celebrities the
name was familiar to him.</p>

<p>“How can I serve you?” answered the man,
kicking the sawdust-filled cuspidor into the middle
of the floor. “I am Judge Lomax, but I
have retired from the bench.”</p>

<p>“My name is Marshall, Mortimer Marshall.”</p>

<p>“Colonel Aspley Marshall’s son?”</p>

<p>“Yes sir.”</p>

<p>“Proud to meet you, my boy. Yo’ fathah
was one of my best friends. How can I serve
you?”</p>

<p>“Do you deal in lands? Do you buy and sell
property?” asked Morey directly.</p>

<p>“I am an attorney,” answered Judge Lomax,
“but my legal business throws me more or less
into such business.”</p>

<p>“Have you any knowledge of our place?
That is, do you know anything about the value
of Aspley plantation?”</p>

<p>“I know every foot of it. It is a fine bit of
land.”</p>

<p>“What is it worth?”</p>

<p>Judge Lomax expectorated, rose and consulted
one of the many land charts hanging on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
the wall, and then opened a worn volume on
the table showing the farms of the county by
section lines.</p>

<p>“Well, as to that,” he answered evasively,
“it is hard to say—off hand. Are you desiring
to sell the property?”</p>

<p>“I want to borrow some money on it and,
later perhaps, if the price is right, we may sell
it.”</p>

<p>Judge Lomax looked out of the window.</p>

<p>“I understand,” he said, after a pause, “that
the entire place is mortgaged.”</p>

<p>“For $14,000,” answered Morey. “The Barber
Bank holds the notes. They are due this
fall. I want to pay them and save the place. I
can’t let the land go for $14,000.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good deal of money,” commented
the lawyer.</p>

<p>“But it’s nowhere near the value of the land.
That’s only a little over $20 an acre for it. The
land is certainly worth more than that.”</p>

<p>“I reckon, if you can find a buyer. But it’s
pretty hard to dispose of a parcel of ground
of that size.”</p>

<p>“How much is it worth, in your judgment,
at a forced sale.”</p>

<p>“I, ah, well, I could hardly say, off hand.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>“How much will you lend me on it.”</p>

<p>The lawyer shook his head.</p>

<p>“Money is pretty close just now. And my
clients are a little slow about lending on these
old tobacco plantations. We know they are
good land, but they don’t rank well as security.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t you lend me $15,000 at least?”
asked Morey nervously.</p>

<p>“I’ll look about for you and consult some of
my moneyed clients.”</p>

<p>“When can you give me an answer?”</p>

<p>Judge Lomax knit his brows in thought and
took a fresh chew of tobacco.</p>

<p>“Just you wait here a minute,” he said at
last. “I’ll run out and see a party. Perhaps
I can help you out.”</p>

<p>The lawyer hastened from his office. Ten
minutes went by and he had not returned. The
room was hot. Morey, in an effort to get a
little fresh air moved to one of the windows.
He sat down in it and looked out. At the same
moment he caught sight of Judge Lomax on the
steps of Barber’s Bank, in the next block. By
the side of the lawyer stood the tall, heavy figure
of Major Carey. Morey sprang up, looked
again and then watched the two men in earnest
talk for several minutes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>When the attorney came slowly into the room
after another five minutes Morey knew what
the verdict would be. Instinctively he had come
to a quick conclusion. Judge Lomax had put
him off until he could consult the enemy.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid,” began the lawyer, “that it’s
going to be difficult to do what you want. Money
is pretty tight now.”</p>

<p>“Then you can’t do it?” said Morey with
composure.</p>

<p>“Not just now—later, perhaps.”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t mind telling me what Major
Carey instructed you to say the land was
worth?” continued the boy, successfully suppressing
his indignation.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“You know what I mean. You’ve done me a
low down trick. I saw you rush right over to
Barber and Carey for orders. Do you get a
commission from them for not dealing with
me?”</p>

<p>“I’ll kick you downstairs.”</p>

<p>“Try it.”</p>

<p>The boy stood ready, his clear eyes fixed on
the embarrassed loan agent.</p>

<p>“You’re not a lawyer,” sneered Morey,
“you’re a shyster.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>Judge Lomax started forward, but Morey
squared himself.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m not afraid of you—tattle tale!” exclaimed
the boy, knowing no more expressive
epithet. “Come on!”</p>

<p>“If you weren’t a child—”</p>

<p>“Got your orders, did you?” taunted Morey.
“You’re a fine bunch here in this town. I’ll
see you all, later. And I’ll make you all feel so
small you can jump through a finger ring. And
mark me,” added the boy, “if <em>you</em> ever get
yourself mixed up with this Aspley place deal
I’ll come for you first.”</p>

<p>He turned and was about to leave the room
when something prompted him to look around.
The lawyer, white of face and trembling like
a leaf, had lunged forward and an iron paper
weight whizzed past the boy’s head striking and
shattering the white frosted glass in the door.
Morey dodged, stumbled, recovered himself and
then, his own anger getting the better of him,
he, too, sprang forward. The crazed lawyer
was reaching for some object on his disordered
desk. Morey could not see what it was—it
might be a deadly weapon. He himself was unarmed.</p>

<p>Alarmed and frenzied the boy threw himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
forward, leaped on the lawyer’s back, clasped
him in his strong young arms just as he caught
sight of a revolver and then hurled the struggling
man with all his might to the floor. There
was a crash as Judge Lomax’s head struck the
wooden cuspidor. The revolver rolled under
the table and <a href="#image03">Morey ran from the office</a>.</p>

<p>It was now noon. Lee’s Court House streets
were deserted. Hastening to the front of Barber’s
Bank, where he had left Betty, Morey
was about to mount when, to his surprise, Captain
Barber and Major Carey suddenly appeared
in the door of the bank. Morey was
fighting mad.</p>

<p>“I’ve just left your friend, Judge Lomax,”
exclaimed the boy impudently. “He’s on the
floor of his office with a busted head. He delivered
your message all right.”</p>

<p>“Morey,” said Major Carey sharply and
sternly. “You’ve lost your senses. You’re going
too far. You’re making the mistake of your
life.”</p>

<p>“Somebody’s making a mistake—Judge Lomax
did. You gentlemen have been running this
town so long that you think you own it. I reckon
the people here think you do. <em>I</em> don’t.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94-<br />95]</a><br /></span></p>

<p>Major Carey came forward across the walk
with all the dignity that was commensurate with
his indignation.</p>

<p>“Come into the bank. We want to talk to
you,” he ordered with the authoritative tone of
a parent.</p>

<p>“Are you ready to make a settlement for the
rent of the corn land?”</p>

<p>A couple of bystanders were within earshot
and the two bankers looked at each other in
alarm.</p>

<p>“When I enter your office again, Major Carey,
I’ll be ready to settle with you. I hope
you’ll be ready to settle with me.”</p>

<p>And jumping on fat Betty’s back Morey loped
down the dusty street toward Aspley place two
miles away.</p>

<p>At home he found a note from Lieutenant
Purcell with the returned fishing rod. The note
said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="noi">“My dear young friend:</p>

<p>“I had hoped to bring the rod in person and
to have the pleasure of meeting you and your
mother. I cannot thank you too much for the
kind invitation you gave me and am most grateful
for the use of your rod. I am forced today
to proceed at once to Washington in the line of
my present duty and for some weeks shall be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
stationed at Fort Meyer. Possibly, on my return,
after a month or so, we may meet again.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Fred Purcell.</span>”</p>
</div>

<p>Morey passed a good part of the afternoon
in his room. He thought, figured, walked the
floor and at times went out into the yard and
looked critically at things that, heretofore,
he had never seen. At the evening meal his
mother commented on his quietness. She attributed
it to disappointment over the loss of
his aeroplane motor.</p>

<p>“After all, Mortimer,” she said indulgingly,
“I’ve been wondering today if we were not just
a little hard with you. Perhaps it might be arranged.”</p>

<p>The boy smiled, patted his mother’s shapely
hand and said:</p>

<p>“Don’t bother about that, mater. I’ve put it
out of my mind. Major Carey’s arguments
were absolutely convincing.” And he smiled
again.</p>

<p>“We never can repay Major Carey for all
he has done for us,” said Mrs. Marshall, sipping
her tea.</p>

<p>“Well, any way, I’m going to try,” answered
Morey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>But this meant nothing to Mrs. Marshall, who
was buttering a biscuit.</p>

<p>“You had quite a long talk with our old
friend. What was the nicest thing he said to
you?”</p>

<p>“He said I inherited some of your qualities,”
answered Morey with another smile.</p>

<p>“The kind old flatterer,” murmured Morey’s
mother.</p>

<p>Nor could she then understand why Morey
laughed so heartily. As the two left the table,
on an inspiration, the boy took his mother in
his arms and kissed her. It was the last kiss he
gave her for some weeks.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a><br />
<small>THE SECRET OF AN OLD DESK.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Full as the day had been for Morey the coming
of night did not put a stop to the working of
his brain. Thinking seriously for the first time
in his life, he had enough to engage him. Concerning
his encounter with Judge Lomax he
said nothing. In comparison with the difficult
problem of saving his mother’s property
this encounter was a small matter. And yet
it was this that decided his first step in the
struggle that was before him.</p>

<p>The boy was hungry for advice, the counsel
of some good friend. His first thought was of
Lieutenant Purcell. The soldier was a stranger,
but Morey had already cut himself off from the
people at Lee’s Court House whom, twenty-four
hours before, he would have counted as his best
friends.</p>

<p>“There isn’t one of them, young or old,” said
the lad to himself, “who would give me a square
deal if it cost them a cent.” And by “them”
he meant Carey, Barber and Bradner of the
bank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>Since Lieutenant Purcell had already left for
Washington this avenue of help was closed.
Morey’s mother, of course, could be of no more
assistance than a child. Never before had Morey
felt so lonesome. For the first time he realized
that he was fatherless and alone. When night
fell a breeze came down from the mountains
and it became too cool to stay outdoors. Mrs.
Marshall, who had been sitting on the decaying
gallery, retired to the musty old parlor and
after Mammy Ca’line had lighted the crystal-hung
table lamp, she made herself comfortable
with an ancient copy of Dickens. Morey, standing
by her side, gazed upon the shadowy painting
of his father.</p>

<p>Suddenly, out of the new longing in him, came
an inspiration; he bethought him of his father’s
old room and desk and papers. Perhaps there
might be something there, some scrap to help
him in his dilemma. He had no idea what there
might be among his father’s things. But at
least, since he had never even looked inside the
desk, he wished to do so. He did not speak of
what was in his mind, for the room and its contents
were held almost sacred by his mother.</p>

<p>Slipping quietly from his mother’s side, he
had not reached the door when she recalled him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mortimer,” she said in her tone of fine
breeding, “I have been worrying about you all
evening. We have not been considerate enough.
I have been thinking of your dear father.”</p>

<p>“Yes, mother, so have I.”</p>

<p>“Major Carey says you take after me in some
respects.”</p>

<p>Morey smiled.</p>

<p>“It is your father you resemble. This wild
fancy of yours is natural. If your father had
had his way—”</p>

<p>Then she paused and sighed.</p>

<p>“What, mother? I never knew—”</p>

<p>“You never knew that he spent two years
abroad as a young man—that he studied in Germany—chemistry
I think.”</p>

<p>Morey caught his mother’s arm.</p>

<p>“Some foolish idea. But he abandoned it.
His father wished otherwise and he was as dutiful
as you are going to be.”</p>

<p>“What was it?” exclaimed Morey. “What
was his idea? What were his hopes?”</p>

<p>His mother sighed again.</p>

<p>“I never understood,” she added. “It was
all behind him when I knew him first. But it
was something about paint made out of rocks
or dirt—I can’t remember now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>“And they wouldn’t let him work out his
ambitions?” exclaimed Morey.</p>

<p>His mother smiled.</p>

<p>“He became a planter, a gentleman and my
husband.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Morey, a little bitterly, “don’t
think of me any more this evening if it makes
you think of father.”</p>

<p>“And he had other notions,” continued Mrs.
Marshall in a reminiscent tone, “why, before
we were married, he had a workshop somewhere
here on the plantation.”</p>

<p>“What was he working on?” asked Morey
abruptly.</p>

<p>The mother shook her head.</p>

<p>“I never knew,” she answered lightly, “but
I do know, now, that his boy ought not be blamed
for having the same fancies. I know you’ll get
over them,” she said, patting his hand, “and
that’s why I’ve relented. It may be extravagant
but, Morey, I’m not going to countermand
your purchase. You may have your engine.”</p>

<p>His mother straightened up in her chair ready
for Morey’s burst of gratitude. But it did not
come.</p>

<p>“It’s awfully good of you,” said Morey
slowly and with the tears almost in his eyes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
“but I’m reconciled. I think Major Carey
knows best. We can’t get it just now.”</p>

<p>“Morey, I’m proud of you. There you are
really like your father. He quit his foolish experiments
to please me.” And drawing the lad
to her she patted his cheek.</p>

<p>Morey’s head filled with a dozen ideas—among
them, the wild desire to examine his
father’s desk drew him like a magnet. When
his mother had returned to her book again the
boy slipped into the hall. A single candle flickered
in the gloom. With this in his nervous
fingers he made his way to the hall above. He
knew that his father’s old office and study—the
room in front across from his mother’s bed
room was locked but he knew, too, where her
keys hung. From the hook at the head of her
bed he took these and, a moment later, he was
in the long-locked apartment.</p>

<p>He had been in it before but never alone. The
air was heavy and hot. Between the two front
windows stood the flat-topped table with its three
drawers on each side. In the room were many
other things—discarded clothing, two trunks,
a case of books, a box of plantation account
books—all these Morey had seen and wondered
at on the few occasions when he had been permitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
to remove, from time to time, his father’s
saddle, gun, rod and—only the fall before, as a
great prize—the old riding crop.</p>

<p>But these things did not interest him now.
Falling on his knees he drew open the drawers,
tight with disuse. Each was full; insurance
policies, bills of sale, weight tickets, auction lists,
letters, small account books. In one a case of
pistols; in another, European guide books and
old steamship circulars. His hands covered
with dust and his clothes white with it he paused
after a quick examination. Then, with boyish
impulse he turned again to the drawer containing
the pistol case. As he drew the case from
its dusty bed he saw, beneath it, a flat packet
of blue paper tied with red tape.</p>

<p>Holding the mahogany pistol box under one
arm with his free hand he lowered the dripping
candle to the drawers. On the packet, about
eight inches long by four inches wide and an
inch deep, he read with difficulty, for the inscription
was in faded brown ink: “To whom
it may concern. A dream of the future. Aspley
Marshall, February 5th, 1889.”</p>

<p>Grasping the package, he let the pistol case
sink back into the drawer and, his heart beating
wildly, hurried from the room. Locking the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
door and replacing the keys, he ran to his own
little bedroom at the far end of the dark and
wide upper hallway. Lighting his own candle
he hesitated a moment and then slipped the rotten
tape from the parcel.</p>

<p>Opened, the packet turned out to be twelve
sheets of heavy blue letter paper. The two bottom
ones were covered with the outlines of a
mechanical device resembling the cylinder of
an engine. These were in black with figures
on them in red, and seemed to be front and side
elevations of some power apparatus. Next to
them were two sheets of formulæ in red figures
with chemical equations. Morey made no attempt
to understand them. Like the projections
on the last pages they were beyond his comprehension.
Between these four sheets and a single
sheet containing a few lines in brown ink
on top, lay seven closely written pages beginning,
“Stuttgart, 1888—Last will and testament
of a man with a dream.”</p>

<p>The inscription on the top sheet, evidently
written later, was brief:</p>

<p>“To whomsoever may take the trouble to
open and read this record:</p>

<p>“To those who are striving to harness and
apply the forces of nature to man’s uses, these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
experiments are dedicated and bequeathed. In
the knowledge that hydrogen gas in its free and
pure state is the most powerful force known,
I herein propound, theoretically, the practicability
of using it as a motive power. The inefficiency
of coal, as transformed into steam,
and the known high efficiency of hydrogen as an
explosive force being recognized, placing it first
in the list of potentialities, I suggest the introduction
of hydrogen gas into engine cylinders.
The following pages discuss:</p>

<p>“1. The liquefaction of pure hydrogen to
render it practically portable.</p>

<p>“2. Its admixture with air behind a piston
to secure a maximum of expansive force.</p>

<p>“In brief, a plan for indefinitely increasing
the power of gas engines by mixing unstable
hydrogen with air.”</p>

<p>Morey laid the sheets on the table as if they
weighed pounds. He drew a long breath and
whistled.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you think of that,” he exclaimed
to himself.</p>

<p>He had no idea what it meant. But that was
not his first surprise. His astonishment was
over the fact that such a record had been made
by his father. That was more than he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
reason out. Then he read the top sheet again.</p>

<p>“The practicability of using hydrogen gas
as a motive power!”</p>

<p>Suddenly a bit of information Morey had
learned at Hammondsport came back to him—“hydrogen
is sixteen times as powerful as dynamite.”</p>

<p>He began thinking. “When my father wrote
that we had no automobiles and no automobile
motors. We had not even dreamed of the aeroplane
and the delicate, powerful engine it demands.
His idea must have been a dream. If
he had a practical plan for increasing the efficiency
of the motor he thought ahead of his
day.”</p>

<p>Morey tried to examine further into the technical
manuscript. But it was wholly beyond
him. In the midst of his examination he sprang
to his feet.</p>

<p>“The trouble with aeroplanes,” he said to
himself, “is that the power developed is not
sufficient. My father’s dream may solve the
problem. His hydrogen may make engines powerful
enough to make the perfect airship.”</p>

<p>The perplexities of the day seemed to disappear.
Rays of hope burst through the gloom
of the boy’s despondency. Mingled with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
wave of sorrow that swept over him when he
thought of his little understood, and no doubt
disappointed father, was a sudden glow of enthusiasm.
He would finish his father’s work.
He would carry forward the dream into a practical
idea for the sake of his mother.</p>

<p>It was nine o’clock. Tingling with excitement
Morey hastily concealed the precious
manuscript and drawings in his trunk and
sought his mother. In the lower hall he heard
a familiar low whistle. It was Amos crouching
in the dark at the foot of the stairs. The black
boy put his hand on Morey’s arm and motioned
him silently to come out to the rear of the house.
He shook his head ominously.</p>

<p>“Wha’ fo’ yo’ don’ tell me yo’ beat up Jedge
Lummix?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t beat him up,” laughed Morey.</p>

<p>“Dey say yo’ nigh kilt ’im. De town’s all
’citement.”</p>

<p>“Is he hurt?” asked Morey, a little alarmed.
Then he told the colored boy what had happened.
At the end Amos shook his head.</p>

<p>“I been to town fo’ a pail o’ lard. Marshall
Robi’son gwine come fo’ yo’ in de mornin’. Yo’
gwine be ’rested an’ locked up. Da’s what.”</p>

<p>“Who told you?” asked Morey now thoroughly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
alarmed. “I only acted in self defense.
They can’t do anything to me.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Robi’son done ast me was I Miss Marshall’s
boy. An’ he said I kin tell yo’ he gwine
come an’ git yo’ tomorrer.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t he come today?”</p>

<p>Amos shook his head.</p>

<p>“Ain’t tol’ me dat. But yo’ better make
has’e and see Major Carey.”</p>

<p>“Is that what he told you to say?” asked
Morey indignantly, clinching his fists.</p>

<p>“Da’s what he says prezacly.”</p>

<p>Morey walked down the path in a feverish
quandary, Amos following him like a dog. Why
had he not been arrested at once if a warrant
was out? Why should he be told to go and see
Major Carey? The possibilities alarmed him.
What if he was arrested and fined? He had no
money to pay a fine. Would he be locked up
in jail? Would the whole thing be used as a
club over him? And just when he had the
big, new project in mind—a resolution to put
his father’s dream to the test?</p>

<p>Suddenly a wild thought came to him. His
face flushed and then his jaw set. He did not
mean to be arrested and submit to the disgrace
of it; he was determined to see and consult with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
those who would properly estimate the value of
his mother’s farm and sell it if possible; he
meant to find those who could understand the
meaning of his father’s secret. He had resolved
to leave Aspley Place at once. But where
should he go? There was only one answer. He
had but one friend old enough to advise him—Lieutenant
Fred Purcell. But Lieutenant Purcell
was in Washington.</p>

<p>At eight o’clock the next morning, when
Mammy Ca’line took Mrs. Marshall’s black coffee
to her room she found, beneath the door, a
note. She handed it to her mistress, who read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Dear Mother: I have gone away for a short
time—a few weeks, I reckon. It’s on business.
Amos is with me. I took him because I know
you’ll feel better about my going. Don’t worry.
I can’t tell you where I am. In a short time
I’ll write. You’ll hear that I licked Judge
Lomax. I didn’t. He insulted me and I protected
myself. If Major Carey or Captain Barber
asks you where I am, tell him it’s none of
their business. I’m sorry I couldn’t tell you
good-bye, but I was afraid you wouldn’t stand
for what I’m doing, and I had to go.</p>

<p>“Amos, we’re going traveling,” exclaimed
Morey.</p>

<p>“Yo’ gwine run away?”</p>

<p>“I’m going to run away and you are going
with me.”</p>

<p>“No, sah. I ain’t done no hahm. I ain’t

<p>“I’m not scared, exactly, but I’m going away.
I am going to seek my fortune.” The boy
smiled as he said it. Could he have seen the

indeed.</p>

<p>“I’m going to leave this place; goin’ away to

already. All you have to know is this—did you
ever hear of any one working for a living?”</p>

<p>“Not no white person, ’less’n he wanted to.”</p>

<p>“Me gwine to Whas’ton?”</p>

<p>“Tonight. And we start as soon as we can

<p>The black boy had edged away in a state of
half terror.</p>

<p>“No, sah, chile. No, sah, Marse Morey. My
pa won’t let me.”</p>

<p>“Your father won’t know anything about it.

<p>“No, sah, Marse Morey, I can’t do dat. I
been to Linden once when de circus show was
dere and pa done lambast me fo’ dat. How fur
dat Wash’ton?”</p>

<p>“About seventy-five miles.”</p>

<p>“An’ yo’ reckon we gwine git dar wid ole
Betty?”</p>

<p>“Or walk.”</p>

<p>“Escuse me. Escuse me. How yo’ mean
’bout dat ‘fortune and wukkin’?”</p>

<p>“I mean, Amos, that things aren’t going right
around here. We may have to move away from
Aspley Place.”</p>

<p>“Yo’ done makin’ spoht—”</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you about it, but I’ve got to go
away to arrange things so that my mother and
your father and Mammy Ca’line and you and
I can stay here. If you don’t come along and
help me and look after Betty we’ll have to find
another home.”</p>

<p>Amos was open-mouthed.</p>

<p>“We all ain’t got no other home, Marse Morey.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
We’s bound to stay here. Who gwine
make us go ’way?”</p>

<p>“Never mind, now. But if you won’t go I’ll
have to go alone. I thought you’d stick by me.”</p>

<p>“Who gwine do chores fo’ Mammy?”</p>

<p>“Who’s going to look after me?” answered
Morey.</p>

<p>The black boy was in a quandary.</p>

<p>“I reckon yo’ ma gwine blame me fo’ dis.”</p>

<p>“Amos, did you ever hear of Don Quixote?”</p>

<p>“Dat a seegar?”</p>

<p>“Don Quixote was a man. He lived a long
time ago—before even the Marshalls began to
raise tobacco. He was poor as, as, well as we
are. But, like a young man I know, this didn’t
seem to make much difference to him. He sat,
day after day, reading books about impossible
things for this was in the time of chivalry—”</p>

<p>“Yas, sah—I knows dat—chivaree. Da’s
when yo’ get married.”</p>

<p>Morey laughed, stopped his story and laying
his hand on Amos’ arm led him into the dark,
silent house, up the stairs to his room and, closing
the door, lit his candle.</p>

<p>“Like to hear more about Don Quixote?” he
asked, sitting down on his trunk.</p>

<p>“I ain’t hear ’bout him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, he was a fine fellow, only he was crazy.
He got so twisted in his head that he couldn’t
see anything straight. He thought his home
and the things about him were all right. But
the place was tumbling over his head and he
didn’t know it. When his servant stole chickens
for him—”</p>

<p>“Who stole chickens? I ain’t steal no chickens.
We done borrow ouah chickens.”</p>

<p>Morey held up a warning finger, with a smile.</p>

<p>“He couldn’t even see that the barn was rotten
and no use; that there were weeds all over
his place; that the house was too old to stand
up.”</p>

<p>Amos sighed and knit his brows in an effort
to connect the old knight with something he
could grasp mentally.</p>

<p>“And that wasn’t the worst,” went on Morey,
“when Don Quixote got so bad that he began
to ‘see things’; when he was ‘conjured’ out
of his wits, he up, one day, and decided to leave
his home and seek his fortune in other places.”</p>

<p>“He done gwine to Wash’ton?”</p>

<p>“About the same thing,” explained Morey.
“He took his old horse and rode away looking
for—well everything he didn’t have at home.”</p>

<p>“Dey gwine to take his farm away?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>“No,” went on Morey, “he just went because
he had a foolish idea that the impossible things
he had read about might come true.”</p>

<p>Amos sighed again.</p>

<p>“Dey comin’ fo’ yo’ in de mawnin’” he interrupted.</p>

<p>“That isn’t all about Don Quixote. He went
away and everything turned out wrong. If it
hadn’t been for one thing the old man would
have starved. He had all kinds of trouble. How
do you reckon he got home again, all safe and
sound?”</p>

<p>“How dat?” queried the black boy, straining
his wits to understand.</p>

<p>“I say, the old Knight of La Mancha, in other
words, Don Quixote, filled with the delusion that
the world was really a land of chivalry, which
in truth had even then passed away, set forth
upon his knightly steed to do deeds of valor in
honor of fair ladies and to show his courage.
Instead he found only derision, cuffs, kicks and
a foodless reception. How then, do you imagine
he was able to return home again?”</p>

<p>“Mus’ ’a been dat chivaree.”</p>

<p>“Listen, Amos, this crazy old man got back
home because the only person in all the world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
who really cared for him went with him and
looked after him.”</p>

<p>“He done have a colored man?”</p>

<p>“Almost. He had old Sancho Panza. Sancho
was his boy, and he never left him.”</p>

<p>Amos was in sore straits. Morey said no
more for a few moments, but he began making
preparations for his departure. He laid out
a few clothes and took down the old, battered
traveling bag that he had unpacked but the day
before; the black boy’s eyes filled with tears.</p>

<p>“Marse Morey,” whimpered Amos, “yo’
ain’t foolin’ me? Yo’ sho’ gwine away to
Wash’ton?”</p>

<p>“As soon as I can pack my grip, write a note
to my mother, get together all Mammy Ca’line’s
loose food and hitch up.”</p>

<p>“An’ yo’ ain’t goin’ to tell yo’ ma?”</p>

<p>Morey shook his head.</p>

<p>“But she ain’t gwine skin yo’ like my pa
trounce me!”</p>

<p>“I’ll see that you aren’t punished.”</p>

<p>Big tears rolled down Amos’ sunken cheeks.
Then his big black hands wandered over his
patched and tattered garments. As Morey laid
some fresh linen in his valise the colored boy
looked shamefacedly at his own faded blue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
calico shirt. Then he dug his shoeless toes into
the carpet.</p>

<p>Finally, with a gulp, he exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Marse Morey, I jes’ natchally cain’t.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ve got to go alone and take my
chances,” answered Morey, opening his trunk
and taking out the blue packet, his father’s
“dream,” that was to mean so much to him.</p>

<p>“I ain’t got no clo’es,” almost sobbed the
black boy.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with your meetin’ pants
and the shoes you had on last night?”</p>

<p>“Dem’s my <em>Sunday</em> cloes!”</p>

<p>“All right. Goodbye.”</p>

<p>“Sides, pa’s in de cabin.”</p>

<p>Morey turned, smiled and put his arm on
Amos’ shoulder.</p>

<p>“Of course you’re going. We’ve lived together
all our lives. You go and tell your father
I want to see him right away, out on the
kitchen gallery. While he is gone pack up your
duds. I’ll tell him to hitch up, that we have to
go to town. Hide your things in the surrey while
he is gone.”</p>

<p>There was no delay in carrying out this plan.
By the time Marsh Green had responded to Morey’s
summons, hooked up old Betty to the surrey
and brought the ancient equipage to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
barnyard gate, Morey was ready. His letter to
his mother had been written and in the weeds
and grass, well down toward the front yard gate
was a little pile of baggage, a bulging traveling
bag, a package of books and circulars, two
blankets and a basket of such food as he could
find—two loaves of bread, a dozen cold biscuits,
a small paper of sugar, a few pinches of tea, a
quart cup, two glasses of jelly, a tin can of some
preserves and a half pound of salt pork. Amos’
baggage was not even tied in a bundle.</p>

<p>“Marse Morey,” said old Marsh, as Morey
and Amos climbed into the creaking vehicle,
“yo doin’ right. Go right to Major Carey. He
git yo’ outen yo’ trouble. But don’t yo’ go
traipsin’ ’roun’ dat Captain Barber. He ain’
no better dan Jedge Lummix. Go right to Major
Carey—he’s yo’ frien.’”</p>

<p>“Still,” laughed Morey, “we might meet
Marshal Robinson and he might put me in jail.
So goodbye until I see you again.” He held out
his hand.</p>

<p>“Go ’long, boy. Ain’t no Marshal Rob’ison
gwine git yo’,” and the old darkey chuckled.
“Amos,” he added with mock sternness, “don’t
yo’ come back ’yar widdout Marse Morey.”</p>

<p>“No, sah, I won’t,” responded the perturbed
Amos.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>“Anyway, goodbye, Marsh, ’till we see you
again. We may not come back right away.
Goodbye.”</p>

<p>The old “overseer” turned away with another
chuckle.</p>

<p>“Major Carey’ll git yo’ outen yo’ mess. I’ll
leab de gate open. Take care ob dat hoss.”</p>

<p>By the time sleepy Betty had reached Morey’s
cache of clothing and provisions, old
Marsh was well on his way back to his cabin. As
Morey stored the valise, basket and blankets in
the surrey, his hand fell on a hard round object.
Drawing it out into the pale starlight he
discovered something tied in an old red bandanna
handkerchief.</p>

<p>“This yours, Amos?” he asked, feeling the
unyielding contents.</p>

<p>“Das mine, shorely.”</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“Ain’t we gwine to Washn’ton?”</p>

<p>“As soon as we can get there!”</p>

<p>“Ain’t dat officer man dar?”</p>

<p>“Lieutenant Purcell? Yes. But—”</p>

<p>“Da’s my rock.”</p>

<p>“Your rock?”</p>

<p>“Da’s ma rock from de crick. Dat soldier
man gwine to git his if we eber comes togedder.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a><br />
<small>MOREY MAKES AMOS A NOTE.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>It was eleven o’clock of a moonless June night
when Morey and Amos closed the disjointed
gate and turned their backs on Aspley Place.
There was a little chill in the air and the vapor
of dew. On each side of the broad and rough
dirt road little more could be seen than the
creeper-covered fences. Neither cabin nor
farmhouse showed a light. Even over the distant
village of Lee’s Court House, toward which
old Betty’s head was turned, hung a pall of
blackness.</p>

<p>Morey was in high spirits. Considering the
dire possibilities of his flight he might well have
been downhearted. But the spell of coming adventure
was on him. He patted his feet on the
rickety bottom of the surrey, he whistled, he
cocked his feet on the loose dashboard as he
smacked the lines on Betty’s back, and he hummed
the darky songs that Amos knew. But
Amos did not join in the choruses. The black
boy was far from being in jovial spirits.</p>

<p>“Yo’ all ain’t gwine plumb thro’ de town is
yo’?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>This was his first concern.</p>

<p>“You don’t think the marshal is awake now,
do you?” answered Morey, with a resounding
“Giddap, Betty.”</p>

<p>“He’s loafin’ on de square, ef de saloons is
open,” Amos assured him.</p>

<p>“Perhaps it would be safer to go around,”
concluded Morey, “but it’s a long way.”</p>

<p>There were no side streets in the village.</p>

<p>“De longes’ way roun’ is de bestes’,” was
Amos’ advice.</p>

<p>As they approached the village, more than
one light could be seen, and Morey, a little to his
own disgust, permitted himself to turn out and
make a long detour around the town. This accomplished,
it was then nearly midnight—he
took the main road to Warrenton. That town
was fifteen miles distant. It had now grown so
cool that both boys wrapped blankets about
themselves, and half asleep and with little to
say, they bobbed against each other while Betty
jogged along.</p>

<p>The night seemed endless. There was no
comfort in trying to sleep curled up on the rear
seat—the road was too rough. Suddenly Morey
roused himself. He had fallen asleep, and he
awoke to find Betty standing by the roadside,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
nibbling at the clover in the fence corner. It
was lighting up in the east and the haze of early
dawn outlined the road dropping away before
him into a wide valley over which lay a heavy
mist. Amos was leaning against him, sound
asleep. It was time for Betty to rest and feed.</p>

<p>Pushing the tired animal forward again until
the bottom of the valley was reached, Morey
came to what he was looking for—a little creek.
Running south was a “river” road. Turning
on to this until he was well into a bottom land
grove of trees, he aroused Amos.</p>

<p>“Wake up, boy; camp number one!”</p>

<p>The colored boy aroused himself and then fell
over asleep again.</p>

<p>“Breakfast!” exclaimed Morey in his ear.</p>

<p>Instantly he bolted upright, glanced about in
an alarmed way and groaned. Blinking his eyes
he whispered:</p>

<p>“Marse Morey, I done had a bad dream.”</p>

<p>“Well, you dream about unhooking Betty and
finding her some water and grass.”</p>

<p>“I done dream dat old crazy man yo’ all’s
tellin’ ’bout been chasin’ me.”</p>

<p>“Don Quixote?”</p>

<p>“Da’s him. He been ridin’ right hyar wid
us in de back seat.” And Amos turned suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
as if expecting to see the ghost of the old
knight sitting in the surrey.</p>

<p>Morey laughed as he forced Betty through
the underbrush.</p>

<p>“What did he say?”</p>

<p>“He been shoutin’ ‘Go on, niggah! Go on,
white boy! I’s wid you!’ No, sah, I ain’t gwine
on, I’s gwine home. Dat ol’ boy sho’ly don’
mean no good. Da’s his ghos’—I seen him. He
cain’t conjure me, no, sah. I don’t reckon I’ll
go no furder. Marse Morey, dat ol’ hoss done
played out a’ready.”</p>

<p>Morey was on the ground limbering his stiffened
limbs and laughing.</p>

<p>“If I could just find my knife I lost,” he murmured
while he felt in his pockets, “I’d cut a
new whip.”</p>

<p>Amos started, opened his mouth and closed it
nervously and then climbed from the surrey
without further comment.</p>

<p>“If any one stole that knife,” continued Morey,
“and I ever found it out I’d get Marshal
Robinson to lock him up. I paid a dollar and a
half for that knife—”</p>

<p>Amos was already busy with Betty. There
was no further complaint about old Don Quixote
conjuring him. When the mare had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
watered in the creek and tied in a bunch of grass
where she might find what sustenance she could,
the sleepy boys had some cold biscuits, jelly and
water, and, with a blanket under them and another
over them, they turned in for a nap.</p>

<p>About noon Morey awoke, stiffer than ever
and hungry as a young bear. The sun had made
its way down through the foliage and he was
wet with perspiration. Amos, the blanket still
over his head, was snoring like a rip saw. As
the white boy reached over to twist Amos’ nose
his hand felt something hard on the blanket by
his side. It was his purloined knife. It had
slipped from the black boy’s pocket. When
Amos finally aroused himself he saw his white
companion sitting by his side carefully examining
the knife.</p>

<p>A look of wild alarm lengthened Amos’ face.
Clasping his big black hand against his pocket
he exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Whar yo’ git dat?”</p>

<p>Morey smiled and pointed to their improvised
bed.</p>

<p>“I found it here between us—here on the
blanket.”</p>

<p>“I ain’t stole no knife! Yo’ ain’t ’spicion me,
is yo’?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’d hate to think you’d steal.”</p>

<p>“Cross ma h’aht, I ain’t stole yo’ knife.”</p>

<p>Morey smiled.</p>

<p>“I wonder who put it here?” he said.</p>

<p>“Marse Morey,” exclaimed Amos suddenly.
“I know who done bring yo’ knife back. De
ghos’ ob de ole crazy man, he brung it. Dat ol’
ghos’ I see in de back seat, he tryin’ to conjure
us. Da’s what.”</p>

<p>“Old Don Quixote’s spirit?”</p>

<p>“Dat old crazy man’s sure wid us. Better
look out, Marse Morey. I’se gwine put a charm
on de ole conjure dis night ef I kin fin’ any
spunk water.”</p>

<p>“And you didn’t take my knife?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you ’sult me, Marse Morey. Don’t
yo’ let ole Keyhole put sech notions in yo’ head.
How come dat knife hyar? Yo’ ast old Keyhole
ghos’—don’ ast me. I reckon we better be gittin
ouah eatin’.”</p>

<p>The noonday meal made deep inroads in the
stock of provisions. When the adventurers had
reached the main road again, crossed the stream
and ascended to the far side of the valley, Warrenton
was before them. They were less than
twenty miles from home and were a little nervous
about being seen so near to Lee’s Court<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
House, but it was necessary to pass through the
village to inquire their way. This led them almost
north.</p>

<p>At two o’clock Betty pulled into the settlement
of Baltimore in Farquar county. The next
town would be Centerville in Fairfax County,
eighteen miles beyond. Baltimore was a crossroads
village with a “hotel,” a blacksmith shop
and two stores. At the hotel, where Betty was
watered from a moss-covered wooden trough as
big as a bath tub, Morey spent twenty-five cents
of his fortune for oats. Crossing the street to
the general store, he expended twenty cents
more for bologna sausage and five cents for
some very old and musty crackers.</p>

<p>About four o’clock, in a shady spot by a little
unbridged stream, a halt was made and Betty
was given water and oats. The two boys regaled
themselves with bread, bologna and jelly. The
afternoon was drowsily warm. Betty was tired
and the cool shade was inviting. Both boys fell
into a doze. In a half hour or so Morey was
awakened by a violent torrent of exclamations.
Amos was chasing and belaboring a gaunt roadside
hog. Of their food the only article left by
this rascally thief was the tin of preserves. The
last of their bread, crackers and all their pork<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
had disappeared. When Amos returned, hot
and angry, he held a scrap of salt pork rind.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you put the things in the wagon,
Sancho?” laughed Morey.</p>

<p>“Dat ain’t no Sanko, da’s a hog. All ouah
suppah and breakfus’ and dinnah gone now.
How far dat Wash’ton?”</p>

<p>“We’ll get there tomorrow,” explained the
white boy with another laugh.</p>

<p>Amos scratched his head.</p>

<p>“We gwine to eat, den?”</p>

<p>“If we have luck.”</p>

<p>“Den I reckon we better has’en on.”</p>

<p>Further investigation revealed another calamity.
Betty, prowling about, had discovered
the paper bag of oats in the rear of the surrey.
She had leisurely consumed the feed reserve.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” expostulated Morey, “there’s
grass and water.”</p>

<p>“I cain’t eat no grass,” remonstrated the
black boy.</p>

<p>“Here’s preserves,” suggested Morey.</p>

<p>“I wants meat, da’s what I wants.”</p>

<p>“You’ve had enough meat for one day,”
laughed Morey, who, being full of bologna sausage,
crackers and jelly, refused to bother about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
the future. “We can boil some greens in our
quart cup this evening.”</p>

<p>The colored boy began to wipe the piece of
pork rind on the grass.</p>

<p>“But no pork—just grass and water,” went
on Morey.</p>

<p>At seven o’clock the white houses of Centerville
rose above the orchards on a distant hill.
The road was up grade and Amos had been
walking to relieve Betty. He had been shaking
his head and growling about the absence of supper.
They had just passed a cabin, some distance
back from the road, when Morey heard a
squawk and a flutter and turned in time to see
the colored boy throw himself on a fat hen. Before
Morey could call out Amos was on his feet
and with one swift, deft whirl he had wrung the
chicken’s neck. Springing forward he hurled
the still kicking fowl into the wagon and springing
up behind called out:</p>

<p>“Git goin’, Marse Morey, de ole woman
comin’.”</p>

<p>Over the tops of the fence weeds Morey could
just make out an excited colored woman waddling
towards the road stile.</p>

<p>“Da’s mah chicken, da’s mah fowl,” she was
crying.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>“Giddap, Betty,” shouted Amos. “De ole
woman got a stick. Make has’e.”</p>

<p>Instead, Morey drew the old horse up sharply
and sprang out.</p>

<p>As the panic-stricken old mammy came rolling
down the road, shaking her stick and yelling
“Da’s mah chicken,” the white boy began
calling, in turn:</p>

<p>“All right, Aunty, don’t get excited. We
made a mistake.”</p>

<p>“Gib me mah fowl,” wailed the colored
woman.</p>

<p>“Two bits,” shouted Morey, “two bits.”</p>

<p>As he held up his last quarter the old colored
woman’s angry face softened. Having satisfied
her, Morey returned to the vehicle and the astounded
Amos.</p>

<p>“Now,” began Morey, “if we should happen
upon a toll gate, we’re stuck. I haven’t a cent.”</p>

<p>Amos shifted uneasily.</p>

<p>“Wha’fo’ you gwine waste yo’ two bits dat
way? We could git away!”</p>

<p>“It was burning a hole in my pocket,”
answered his white companion. “But, Amos,
when you want to steal you’d better not let me
know it.”</p>

<p>“Dat wan’t stealin’. Da’s a wild chicken.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>“I hope it is. We’ll have game for breakfast.”</p>

<p>“Yo’ jes’ fro’ dat two bits away,” growled
Amos.</p>

<p>Betty had been urged ahead and Centerville
was just before them. Amos had crawled into
the rear seat and was mumbling to himself
about the chicken and the squandered quarter.
At last Morey felt a touch on his arm.</p>

<p>“Ef we all had dat money we could get some
crackers and cheese, couldn’t we?”</p>

<p>“You’ll get chicken broiled on a stick if you
get anything tonight. But I reckon we ought to
save the chicken for tomorrow.”</p>

<p>“Cheese and crackers would go pow’ful well.
Dey’s got cheese in dis town.”</p>

<p>Morey whirled about to retort angrily that
the “quarter” episode was closed. But, instead
of reprimanding his colored servitor, he paused
with mouth wide open. Amos’ big black hand
was stretched out towards him. In it were six
nickels.</p>

<p>“Dat two bits?” inquired Amos, in doubt.</p>

<p>“Where did you get that?” asked Morey, recovering
from his surprise.</p>

<p>“I’s got money, I has. Dar’s yo’ two bits yo’
fussin’ ’bout.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>“Have you any more?” asked the white boy,
eagerly.</p>

<p>“I’s got mah banjo money. I been savin’ fo’
to git a banjo fo’ two berry-pickin’s.”</p>

<p>“How much?”</p>

<p>Amos shook his head.</p>

<p>“Ah been too busy to ezackly count it.”</p>

<p>“Let me see—let me count it.”</p>

<p>Slowly and with some misgiving, Amos drew
from his pocket a long-used handkerchief with
a knot in one corner. Morey pulled up Betty
along the road and climbed into the rear of the
surrey. Hardly waiting for the hesitating black
boy to hand over the little treasure Morey took
the handkerchief, slipped the knot and dumped
the earnings of many a day’s work in the berry
patches on the seat.</p>

<p>A crumpled two dollar bill; three silver half
dollars; three dimes; six nickels, and twenty-eight
copper cents.</p>

<p>“Good for you, Amos! Why didn’t you tell
me you had all this money?”</p>

<p>“How much money I got dar?”</p>

<p>“Four dollars and thirty-eight cents.”</p>

<p>“How much is dat, wid dis?” asked Amos,
holding out his six nickels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>“That makes four dollars and fifty-eight
cents.”</p>

<p>“Da’s why I’s goin’,” exclaimed Amos, his
eyes glittering for the first time that day, and
his sunken cheeks swelling with a happy smile.
“I’se gwine to Wash’ton to git mah banjo.”</p>

<p>Morey gathered up the loose coins, took the
nickels from Amos’ clinched fingers and slowly
dropped the treasure into his own pocket. The
black boy gazed open mouthed—too alarmed to
speak. This done, Morey took out his little note
book, his pencil, and on a page of the book he
wrote, hastily:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“I promise to pay Amos Green $4.58 one day
after date, at 7% interest.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Mortimer Marshall.</span>”</p>
</div>

<p>“There, Amos, that’s a note. I’ve borrowed
your money. You’ll get interest on it now.
We’ll stop at the Grand Central Hotel in Centerville
tonight like gentlemen. Giddap, Betty.”</p>

<p>And, while the stiffened old mare began trotting
along again toward the village, Amos sat as
if in a trance, with Morey’s note in his clumsy
fingers.</p>

<small>THE RUNAWAYS DISCOVERED.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>A little after seven o’clock, those citizens of
Centerville who were diligently loafing in front
of the Center House, were amused to see a wobbling
vehicle dash up to that hostelry with an
extraordinary burst of speed. It was hardly
necessary to check the steed that drew the Marshall
surrey, for old Betty stopped of her own
accord at sight of the water trough.</p>

<p>“Boy,” exclaimed Morey, in a gracious but
positive command, “see to the animal.”</p>

<p>Amos was nonplussed. In the days when the
Center House was the Fairfax Inn there had
been ample stable and coach room in the rear,
but these existed no longer. While Morey made
his way into the office of the hotel, Amos stood
holding Betty’s bridle. Morey registered:
“Mortimer Marshall and servant, Lee’s Court
House, Va.”</p>

<p>“Want a regular room for the nigger?”
asked the proprietor.</p>

<p>That had not occurred to Morey.</p>

<p>“What are your rates?” he asked, a little
alarmed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>“Supper’s over,” explained the host, “unless
you want a special meal. Reg’lar rates $2 per
day.” Then he looked out and had another
glance at Amos. “I reckon I kin make it half
price fur the boy. But ef we git supper for you
it’ll be extra.”</p>

<p>Morey made a rapid calculation. He was
tired and hungry and wanted a bath. It couldn’t
come to over $2.50.</p>

<p>“I am traveling,” he answered, “and a little
tired. The accommodations along the road are
not the best. If you have a young chicken I’d
like it broiled with a baked potato, some hot
biscuits, fruit and coffee. My boy will eat with
me—”</p>

<p>“We’ve got ham and eggs and tea,” remarked
the landlord.</p>

<p>“That will do very nicely,” replied Morey
smiling.</p>

<p>“What you goin’ to do with your hoss?”</p>

<p>“My servant will look after the animal.”</p>

<p>“Hain’t got no stable here. Two blocks up,”
exclaimed the Center House host, as he retreated
toward the kitchen.</p>

<p>When Amos had carried Morey’s bag into the
office he drove Betty to “Abson’s Livery, Feed
and Sale Stable,” while Morey, unassisted as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
his bag, followed the proprietor to his room.
Making a brief toilet he waited for the supper
bell. In the course of twenty minutes, hearing
a commotion outside, he stepped to the window.
But it was too dark to see anything. Yet his
suspicions were aroused.</p>

<p>“Hello boy, goin’ to meetin’?”</p>

<p>“Purty slick nigger, eh?”</p>

<p>Morey rushed downstairs. On the newly
sprinkled board sidewalk and in the full glare
of the light stood Amos, a picture of smiles and
colors. In Morey’s trousers—his “meetin’
pants,”—shoes, and one of Morey’s two-year-old
hats, a starchless but glaring white shirt, a
paper collar and a blue ready-made necktie in
which shone an elaborately mounted red stone,
Amos was ready for the admiration of Centerville.</p>

<p>“Rigged out to beat yer boss!” shouted another
humorist.</p>

<p>“Yer meal’s ready,” interrupted the proprietor.</p>

<p>Morey beckoned to the colored boy and led
him into the dining-room.</p>

<p>“What in the world does this mean, Amos?
Where’d you get all this stuff?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t you bodder ’bout whar I git dat. Dese
is mah Sunday clo’es.”</p>

<p>“This isn’t Sunday. What’d you dress up
that way for?”</p>

<p>“Whar I gwine leab ’em? I ain’t no trunk.
I ain’t gwine leab dese garmens’ in no liberty
stable.”</p>

<p>Morey laughed.</p>

<p>“You’re pretty gay for a boy who hasn’t a
cent!”</p>

<p>“Cain’t I hab ten cents, Marse Morey?”</p>

<p>“What do you want ten cents for? You’ve
eaten.”</p>

<p>“I allays has some cin’mon draps w’en I’s
dressed up. An’ I wants one dem cahds, one of
dem pitcher cahds, to send back to pa at de
Co’ht House.”</p>

<p>“You mean one of those picture postal
cards?”</p>

<p>“I ain’t nebber had none o’ dem cahds yit.”</p>

<p>Morey laughed.</p>

<p>“You can have cinnamon drops, Amos, but
we’re not sending back post cards yet.”</p>

<p>The two boys consumed their ham and eggs
and left the dining-room.</p>

<p>“Mr. Marshall,” exclaimed the proprietor, as
Morey passed through the combination parlor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
and office, “I reckon you know ’taint customary
for colored persons to eat in the main dinin’
room.”</p>

<p>“I don’t object,” answered the boy.</p>

<p>“Some o’ the folks about here is findin’
fault.”</p>

<p>“But we were in there alone.”</p>

<p>“It’s the principle o’ the thing. Colored folks
has their place.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you say so before he went in?”</p>

<p>“I reckoned you all knowed it.”</p>

<p>“Well I didn’t. We’ll leave your place if you
prefer.”</p>

<p>“Oh ye’re welcome, yerself, an’ I reckon he
kin stay. But I’m allowin’ yo’ ought to pay extry
fer him instid o’ half price.”</p>

<p>Morey looked at the proprietor and his
usually smiling face changed to a cold expression.
Then he smiled.</p>

<p>“You are the proprietor, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Me and my wife.”</p>

<p>“Well, I am Mortimer Marshall, of Aspley
Place, Lee’s Court House. In my part of Virginia
a contract is a contract. Where I go my
boy goes.”</p>

<p>“A nigger ’at kin dress like that coon, kin pay
his bills, I reckon.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do you want your money now?”</p>

<p>The landlord’s loud talk had attracted a half
dozen town worthies who now crowded into the
little room. The landlord was mad.</p>

<p>“I knowed who you was as soon as you drive
up,” he retorted.</p>

<p>As the agitated hotel keeper reached over and
picked up a newspaper from the ink-smeared
desk the curious onlookers crowded forward,
Amos among them. The matter that had been
the sole topic of conversation for the last half
hour was coming to a dramatic sequel.</p>

<p>“I knowed you. I reckon you all thought we
don’t see no newspapers in Centerville. How
about this piece in the paper?”</p>

<p>Morey took the paper, followed the direction
of a shaking finger and read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noic"><span class="adauthor">MURDEROUS ASSAULT</span><br />
<span class="works">ON MEMBER OF BENCH.</span><br />
Scion of Aristocratic Virginia Family<br />
Attacks Ex-Jurist.</p>

<p>“Lee’s Court House, Virginia.—About noon
today Mortimer Marshall, the son of the late
Colonel Aspley Marshall of Aspley Place, made
a mysterious and as yet unexplained attack on
Ex-Judge E. L. Lomax, in the latter’s offices in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
this city. Marshall escaped, but will be arrested
in the morning. The jurist, who had lain unconscious
for over an hour, finally managed to
call for assistance and he is now lying at his
home with probably fatal wounds. So far, he
has been unable to give but a fragmentary account
of the assault which he says was wholly
unprovoked and made when his back was
turned. Some blunt instrument was used—”</p></div>

<p>Morey threw the paper on the floor.</p>

<p>“That’s a lie, mainly,” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Anyway we don’t want no runaways in the
Center House.”</p>

<p>“Amos,” ordered Morey, “get my bag.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I reckon not,” spoke up the hotel owner,
“not ’till you pony up.”</p>

<p>Amos responded promptly. One over-eager
spectator, the one who had referred to him as a
“slick nigger,” he jostled smartly to one side.
With a set jaw and a look of defiance at the proprietor,
Morey turned, passed down the hall and
mounted the stairs to the room assigned him. A
moment later he was in the office. Dropping his
bag vigorously on the floor he exclaimed:</p>

<p>“What’s my bill?”</p>

<p>The owner of the place had lost a little courage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
by this time. But he stepped around behind
the desk, cleared his throat and said:</p>

<p>“You used that room and it’s the same as
though you slept in it. That’s a dollar. Your
supper was 35 cents. The nigger’s supper’ll be
70 cents. That’s $2.05.”</p>

<p>Morey walked up to the desk. “The room
may be $1.00 a day. You’ve driven me out of it.
I’ll not pay a cent for it. My supper is all right
and a good one for the money. This boy’s meal
was to be half price. That’s 17½ cents. My bill
is 52½ cents. Here’s 53.”</p>

<p>He slapped the coins on the desk and faced
the spectators.</p>

<p>“Now you loafers fall back or you’ll get what
the ex-jurist got and right in front instead of
from behind. Scat!”</p>

<p>A panic struck the open-mouthed Centerville
citizens and they bumped against each other in
their fright. As the two boys were about to step
from the room the man behind the desk made a
feeble request.</p>

<p>“Some one o’ you git the marshal.”</p>

<p>“For what?” snapped Morey.</p>

<p>“Fo’ dis,” sounded by his side, and Amos, the
bag in one hand, shoved forward the red bandanna
containing his carefully preserved rock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>“De fus’ pusson crosses mah path gits dis on
de haid. It’s a dornick.”</p>

<p>Without interruption Morey and the valiant
Amos made their way to the livery barn. The
proprietor, one of the panic-stricken hotel spectators,
came running after them. With nervous
energy he assisted Amos in hitching up Betty.</p>

<p>“What’s <em>your</em> bill?” asked Morey.</p>

<p>The man hesitated.</p>

<p>“I reckon you done owe me ’bout two bits.”</p>

<p>Slowly climbing into the surrey, Morey said:</p>

<p>“Here’s fifty cents for you and I want you to
take a message to your marshal. If he hasn’t a
warrant for my arrest he’d better not follow me.
If he does—I’ll break his head.”</p>

<p>“I reckon you all kin sleep in my barn if you
ain’t got no hotel.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” retorted Morey, “I’ve had enough
of Centerville. It’s small potatoes.”</p>

<p>Passing the drug and grocery store a moment
later, in spite of the already growing crowd of
curious persons, he stopped Betty, alighted and
entered the place.</p>

<p>“Got any cinnamon drops?” asked Morey.</p>

<p>The proprietor, a little out of breath, finally
discovered a jar of the confection several years
old.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>“Gimme a nickel’s worth!”</p>

<p>Gaping faces were in the door while this
transaction was in progress. But as Morey left,
a clear path instantly opened before the desperate
fugitive.</p>

<p>“Amos,” he said, springing into the surrey,
“here’s your cinnamon drops. And for goodness’
sake don’t put on those clothes again without
telling me.”</p>

<p>“Marse Morey,” exclaimed Amos with a sigh,
“I’s ’bliged fo’ dem cin’mon draps, but is we
gwine drive all night?”</p>

<p>“There is a real town on ahead, only seven
miles. If the hotel is more hospitable we’ll
sleep there.”</p>

<p>“How much ma’ money dat gwine cos’?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you bother about money. I’m the one
to worry. You are protected. You have my
note.”</p>

<p>“I’s got de note all right. But I don’ see no
banjo.”</p>

<p>“Forget the banjo. We are playing for higher
stakes.”</p>

<p>“Steaks? We don’ need no steaks. We’s got
a fat pullet.”</p>

<p>“Eat your cinnamon drops and be happy,”
laughed Morey. “Giddap,” he clucked to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
tired Betty and they rolled slowly out of Centerville.</p>

<p>Suddenly, his mouth full of the spicy confection,
Amos grabbed Morey by the shoulder.</p>

<p>“Don’ look dat way, look dis way.”</p>

<p>Whirling the white boy on the seat Amos
pointed to the western horizon. The thin sickle
of a new moon was just visible.</p>

<p>“Yo’ come nigh seem’ dat moon ober yo’
right shoulder. Dat’d sho’ly brung us bad
luck.”</p>

<p>“What shoulder did <em>you</em> see it over?”</p>

<p>“I almos’ seen it ober de left shoulder. I
reckon we’s all right. But I’s kind o’ skeered.
Dat crazy ole man Keyhole boun’ to come back.”</p>

<p>But if he had come back Amos would have
been too tired to recognize the ghost of the old
knight. Still sucking at the cinnamon drops he
soon fell asleep. When he awoke Morey was
dickering with the half-asleep owner of a small
hotel in Fairfax. A little of the young Virginian’s
assurance was gone. He rather humbly
inquired the cost of lodging and breakfast for
himself and Amos and stabling for the horse
and was glad to close the contract at $1.50.</p>

<p>It was midnight when he at last found his bed.
Mr. Perry’s hotel was really only a poorly patronized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
boarding house, but it gave Morey a
chance to get his clothes off and to crawl into a
bed in which, though it was poor enough, he
could straighten out his tired legs. Amos slept
on a cot outside of Morey’s door. Nor did the
boys have the luxury of late hours. They were
turned out promptly at the sound of a cracked
bell at six o’clock. At seven o’clock, having
breakfasted on a few thin slices of very fat bacon
and one egg apiece, the refreshed wanderers
set forth. Washington, their Mecca, was
but eighteen miles away.</p>

<small>ARRIVAL AT FORT MEYER.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The day was just the kind to put vigor and enthusiasm
into one. Old Betty ambled along,
reasonably frisky after a night’s rest, and the
country began to show signs of thickening population.
Amos began to get a little nervous.</p>

<p>“How much money yo’ got now Marse Morey?”
he inquired at last, hesitatingly.</p>

<p>“Oh, ’bout two dollars.”</p>

<p>“How long dat ’gwine keep us when we git to
Wash’ton?”</p>

<p>“Quit your worryin’, Amos. I’ll look after
you. I’ll see that you don’t go hungry.”</p>

<p>“How yo’ gwine do dat? I ain’t got no mo’
money.”</p>

<p>“Well in a pinch, I’m going to sell Betty and
the surrey.”</p>

<p>The colored boy shook his head.</p>

<p>“Yo’ don’ dast sell Betty. Yo’ ma’ll skin yo’
ef yo’ sell de ole hoss. Sides, who gwine buy
dis ole trap? Dat hoss ain’t wuff—”</p>

<p>“Didn’t she carry us all the way here?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>“She sho’ly did, but she cain’t carry us back.
Dat hoss ready fo’ to quit. She got de heaves.”</p>

<p>“We can work,” moralized Morey. “We can
make two dollars and a half a day working.”</p>

<p>“Yo’ ain’t come hyar to do no wuk, I reckon.
How come you go to Wash’ton, Marse Morey?”</p>

<p>“I’m going to make our fortune, Amos. I’ve
got a great invention that I’m going to sell. It
will give us all the money we can use. Then I’m
going to buy a banjo for you and we’re going
back home on the cars and fix up the place and
be real farmers and have pigs and cows and
horses and paint the house and mend the fences
and hire hands to run the farm.”</p>

<p>“Look hyar, boy! Yo’ losin’ yo’ min’! Who
tol’ yo’ we gwine do all dat? Yo’ done been
communin’ wid ole crazy man Keyhole.”</p>

<p>“You wait and see—I’ve got something in my
bag that is going to do all that and more—when
I sell it.”</p>

<p>“We gwine to have money to ride on de steam
cars?”</p>

<p>“You just do as I tell you and follow me and
you’ll not only ride on the steam cars but you’ll
eat on them.”</p>

<p>“Eat on ’em? Who gwine have time to eat on
de steam cars? Yo’ boun’ to look outen de winder.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
I ain’t gwine have no time to eat on de
cars. Talkin’ bout eatin,” went on Amos, “I
reckon we could eat now ef we had de eatin’s.”</p>

<p>“We dine in Washington this evening, Amos.
We won’t bother about it until then. Besides, I
may not sell my big invention this evening and
we’ve got to string out our $2.”</p>

<p>“Dar’s de chicken we done pay two bits fo’.”</p>

<p>Morey reached down, caught hold of the stiffened
fowl and threw it on the roadside.</p>

<p>“It’s too old to eat, Amos. Don’t you ever get
enough food? We just had breakfast. I’ll buy
you a good dinner. Now shut up.”</p>

<p>“One aigg an’ a piece o’ bacon yo’ couldn’
grease a saw wid! Dat ain’t no breakfus’.”</p>

<p>“Amos!” exclaimed Morey sharply. “If you
don’t quit bothering me about eating I’ll ask old
man Keyhole tonight where he got that knife. I
reckon he knows.”</p>

<p>“Well ef yo’ kin stan’ it, I kin. But I certainly
is pow’ful hongry.”</p>

<p>There was a little halt at noon to refresh Betty
with water and a nibble of grass, during
which time Morey washed his face and hands in
the creek by the side of which they had stopped.
Amos had returned to his old clothes, but Morey
now arranged a compromise costume for him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
discarding the pin, tie and hat and making him
presentable in his best trousers, shoes and
white shirt.</p>

<p>The smoke of Washington was already in
sight. By four o’clock the suburban farms had
been reached and Amos saw for the first time
the environs of a city. The smart, up-to-date
homes bewildered him and he drank all in with
wide eyes. They were on the highway that leads
into Alexandria and Morey was beginning to
worry. Just what he was to do now that he had
reached the city he did not know. He could not
figure out what he and his companion were to
attempt first. He would cross the Potomac, enter
the city and, he had almost decided, stop at
the first stable he could find and sell Betty. This
went pretty hard with him, but it was easier
than facing the big city with a helpless colored
boy on his hands and only $1.88 in his pocket.
With the few dollars that he might get by this
means they would find a cheap boarding house
and prepare to look up his friend, Lieutenant
Purcell. If this required several days or his
funds ran out while he was engaged in his negotiations
he had one well-defined idea. He would
find a job for Amos, some simple labor at which
the boy could make enough to keep both going
until fortune turned with them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>Before reaching Alexandria the two boys
found themselves among the country villas of
the middle-class suburbanites. Then the park-like
expanse and neatly trimmed hedges of Arlington
Cemetery rose on their right. Intent on
this pleasing picture, which Amos was slow to
believe was a cemetery—a soldier’s grave-yard—Morey
did not for a time notice another institution
on his left. But, when he did look and saw
the national colors fluttering from a tall, white
flagstaff, and the open parade ground and orderly
rows of officers’ homes, he knew instinctively
that he had stumbled upon Fort Meyer at
the front door of the city. His heart leaped.</p>

<p>Giving Betty a slap with the lines he hastened
on toward the entrance, through which, in the
distance, he could already see a thin stream of
people passing. A moment later the surrey
reached a sort of rear entrance. Here a soldier
on guard duty walked slowly back and forth.</p>

<p>“Is this Fort Meyer?” Morey asked anxiously
as they passed.</p>

<p>“That’s what.”</p>

<p>“May we drive in?”</p>

<p>The soldier, dropping his gun to “parade
rest,” shook his head but jerked his thumb down
the road where people on foot and in carriages
were entering.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>“Come to see the airship?” he remarked.</p>

<p>“What airship?” asked Morey, eagerly.</p>

<p>“I reckon you’re in time,” said the soldier
smiling. “Always in time for them boys. They
fuss around all day and then tell you at dark
that it’s too windy. But I reckon they’ll go up
today,” he added, glancing skyward.</p>

<p>“What airship is it?” persisted Morey, leaning
half out of the vehicle.</p>

<p>“They ain’t but one fur’s the army is concerned,”
laughed the soldier, shouldering his
gun again—“Wright Brothers. Hustle along
and make a bluff. Maybe they’ll let old Dobbin
in.”</p>

<p>“Is Lieutenant Purcell here?” continued Morey,
much excited.</p>

<p>“If he ain’t gone to town, he is,” was the
answer. “He ought to be here. That’s his
business. He’s the boss of the job.”</p>

<p>A few minutes later Morey and Amos were in
the line of spectators making their way toward
the reservation parade grounds. But Betty
could go only within the limits of the fort, where
Morey turned her over to Amos with orders to
await his return. Then he hurried after the
crowd. Undoubtedly it was a gala day. Hundreds
of fashionably dressed women and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
smartly costumed men were defying the dust of
the paths leading to the wide parade grounds
and officers with gold, red and yellow facings on
their uniforms were hurrying by in mule-drawn
military busses.</p>

<p>Near what seemed to be a sort of club-house a
group of soldiers stood idly. On the gallery, a
number of guests were collected in animated
groups. While Morey was debating whether to
make his way thither before seeking the parade
ground where, he had already learned, Orville
Wright was to give an exhibition test of his
wonderful aeroplane, there was the sharp blast
of a bugle and the clatter of horses’ feet. An
open carriage dashed by with three men in it,
preceded by a bunch of galloping cavalrymen.
Hats flew off in all directions and a few of the
spectators cheered.</p>

<p>It was Morey’s first view of a President of the
United States. Throwing his own hat into the
air he lit out on a run after the swiftly moving
carriage, and then, suddenly noticing that there
were no other boys present and that no one else
was excited in just the same manner, he calmed
down and smiled.</p>

<p>“Where’s the airship?” asked the boy, seeing
that the President was bound first for the club-house,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
but figuring that he would proceed to the
testing grounds.</p>

<p>The smart young soldier to whom Morey had
addressed his remark said:</p>

<p>“The high white tent is where the big bugs’ll
be. You keep away from that or they’ll
hustle you. Them secret service ducks got to
make a flash. They won’t let you in a mile o’
the President. The airship stable is the wooden
house between the tent and them barracks. An’
you keep your eye peeled. They ain’t anxious
to have kids around.”</p>

<p>Morey had no trouble. He was frequently
told to move on, but this did not bother him.
Long before the President and the other important
guests had arrived at the tent of honor the
boy was a part of the group before the airship
house. He forgot Amos, Betty and even Lieutenant
Purcell. Pushing through the crowd he
kept always in front, and, whenever it became
necessary to clear out the interfering spectators,
Morey was always the first one shoved
aside.</p>

<p>In the intervals he saw the mysterious machine,
drank in its details, watched all the fascinating
work of preparation, gazed in open-mouthed
wonder on the wizard who was to demonstrate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
the wonders of the fragile craft and,
when he could, stole nearer to the magic apparatus.
When the tooting band marched across
the worn and dusty expanse of the parade
ground, instead of rushing away with the crowd
to welcome the Chief Magistrate and the other
distinguished guests, Morey took advantage of
the laxity of the guards to steal up to the shed
itself.</p>

<p>On a box sat two men, one of them the celebrated
aviator whom Morey had already seen
inspecting the track, and the other a military
man. A workman had already sung out “Skiddoo,
kid!” when a familiar voice stopped the
lad. Morey recognized at a glance Lieutenant
Purcell, hot of face, black of hands and in his
shirt sleeves, but the soldier in spite of all.</p>

<p>“Get out!” exclaimed Mr. Wright.</p>

<p>“One moment!” interrupted the officer, laying
his hand on the aviator’s arm and whispering
to him: “Come here,” he added, motioning
to Morey.</p>

<p>“This is Morey, isn’t it?” he smiled, extending
his soiled hand. “I’m awfully glad to see
you. Did you get the rod and my note? And
what are you doing here? Excursion?”</p>

<p>“I drove here,” responded Morey, a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
abashed, “and I came—I reckon—I came to
find you.”</p>

<p>“To see me? Well, that’s good of you. Are
you alone?”</p>

<p>“Amos is with me,” laughed Morey. “Your
friend, the colored boy.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I remember,” laughed the officer. “I
hope he is well.”</p>

<p>“Well and hungry,” answered Morey. And
then he blushed.</p>

<p>“You came to see me?” went on the officer.
“Then I hope, as soon as I am through with our
afternoon’s work, to see you at my quarters.
Ask any one for my house. Come for dinner
and bring Amos. I must make my peace with
the boy.” And he laughed again.</p>

<p>“Did you ever see an aeroplane before?” inquired
Mr. Wright politely, as if feeling that he
had to say something.</p>

<p>“I was around Mr. Curtiss’ shop a good deal
last month,” explained Morey, “and I’ve done
some gliding myself.”</p>

<p>“Oh I see,” interrupted Lieutenant Purcell.
“Then you are interested.”</p>

<p>“I certainly am,” said Morey. “That’s why
I came here to see you. I want to consult you
about an idea I have—it was my father’s.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Wright smiled.</p>

<p>“They’ve all got it,” he remarked.</p>

<p>“They haven’t all got this,” replied Morey
abruptly. “Even <em>you</em> haven’t got it. But I
think you will have it, some day.”</p>

<p>Both men looked at him questioningly.</p>

<p>“Well,” answered Mr. Wright with a laugh,
“we try a new idea every day. Perhaps yours
is the one we are after.”</p>

<p>As the two men heard the sound of a bugle
they sprang to their feet.</p>

<p>“Can I help you launch her?” asked Morey
anxiously.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright laughed again.</p>

<p>“Why not?” he answered. “If you have
ideas about these machines you certainly will
beat these clumsy soldiers.”</p>

<p>“Take off your coat, Morey,” remarked the
Lieutenant, “and get busy. Then, when we are
through, we’ll see about your idea.”</p>

<p>Morey, elated over the great privilege
granted him, lost no time in taking advantage
of it. While Mr. Wright, Lieutenant Purcell
and the experienced workmen who were to assist
in launching the aeroplane were hurrying the
last preparations, he crowded close to the craft.
It was beautiful in its fragile symmetry and
Morey hung over it as an artist might examine a
picture. An attendant was pouring in gasoline
and Mr. Wright was intently watching him
when a middle-aged military man entered the
shed.</p>

<p>“Everything all right?” he exclaimed in a
full deep voice.</p>

<p>“So far as we know,” answered Mr. Wright,
smiling. “But that is what we never know exactly.
If I had a guarantee that it was, I
wouldn’t hesitate to go up a thousand feet.”</p>

<p>As he said this he shook hands with the new
arrival. Lieutenant Purcell promptly saluted
and exclaimed: “Major Squiers.”</p>

<p>Morey took another look. This, then, was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
head of the U. S. Signal Corps—the army authority
on ballooning and air navigation. Morey
knew that he was looking at the best posted man
in the country on the subject that so appealed
to him, and he wondered if he might get the opportunity
to lay his father’s plans before such
an authority.</p>

<p>“Looks like a fine afternoon for the trial,”
went on the visitor. “The President is ready.
You can go when you like. I wish you luck.”</p>

<p>Just then his eye fell on Morey and he
frowned.</p>

<p>“He’s all right,” remarked Mr. Wright.
“That’s our new assistant—he isn’t in the
way.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the Major—his frown relaxing—“you
must look out for strangers.”</p>

<p>“I’ll answer for this young man,” spoke up
Lieutenant Purcell. At the same time he
stepped to his superior and spoke in a low voice.</p>

<p>Morey was already lost again in his intent examination
of the airship. He had never seen
anything that so interested him. The machines
at Hammondsport were experimental and
roughly finished. This white winged, complete
car appealed to his enthusiasm and he was already
in a land of dreams. If there had ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
been any doubt about his ambition this meeting
with the great wizard of the air and this close
contact with his fairy-like creation would have
decided Morey’s future. He determined to become
an aviator and the owner of such a craft
if it took years of effort.</p>

<p>In the midst of his close inspection of the
waiting machine the boy started, looked again,
and then turned to those in charge. The eager
attendants had just taken their stands ready to
shoulder the long spruce framework to carry it
outside the house to the starting track.</p>

<p>“Mr. Wright,” whispered Morey, touching
the great inventor on the arm, “look here. I
think a link of your chain drive is bent.”</p>

<p><a href="#image04">Mr. Wright</a> and Lieutenant Purcell <a href="#image04">sprang
forward</a> together as Morey laid his finger on
one of the little steel squares of the right hand
link belt used to connect one of the propellers
with the engine. One corner was bent sharply
upward. The first examination showed that the
steel link was cracked. Mr. Wright spoke under
his breath as his helpers crowded about him
and then ordered the doors closed. The next
few moments were busy ones. Every one
sprang to the task of repairing the damage.
Mr. Wright with a wrench loosened the chain
while others brought punches and a substitute
link. When the defective bit of steel had been
removed and a new link put in its place the
perspiring inventor arose, wiped his forehead,
and turned to those watching him. He had
picked up the broken bit of metal. After looking
at it intently and showing it to Lieutenant
Purcell he turned to Morey.</p>

<p>“How did you happen to see that, my boy?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I just noticed it—I thought they ought
to be perfect, all of them. So I looked ’em all
over. I knew a bad one might dump you.”</p>

<p>“I certainly would have been dumped and
worse. It might have been my last flight. I
can’t say much except that I thank you. Here,”
he added, laughing, “take this as a souvenir.”
He handed Morey the broken link. “And whenever
you see it, just remember that I’d be glad
to do something for you.”</p>

<p>A few minutes later the aeroplane was out
and on the track and as it sailed away to the
applause of the hundreds watching it only a
few knew that the country boy already racing
over the dusty parade ground beneath the hovering
airship had counted for so much in making
the experiment possible and successful. It
was indeed successful, for it was on this momentous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
day that Mr. Wright demonstrated to
the Signal Corps and the world that his aeroplane
could fly forty-five miles an hour. In doing
this the machine was in the air a little over
an hour.</p>

<p>As it finally drifted toward the landing place
after circling the course many times the first
face that the straining aviator made out was
Morey’s. And it was Morey’s proud assertion,
many a time later, that it was of him that Mr.
Wright asked—</p>

<p>“Did I do it?”</p>

<p>In the excitement that followed, Mr. Wright
and Lieutenant Purcell disappeared. As soon
as the aircraft was within the shed those gentlemen
were carried away by Major Squiers to
meet the President, who had hastened forward
compliment the nervy aviator. But Morey had
no thoughts of distinguished guests. With his
coat off he now helped to carry the aeroplane
into the house and, with the other workmen, to
adjust it on its supporting trusses. The attendants
were excited and enthusiastic and they
worked over the car as if it had been an exhausted
race horse, cleaning the engine, tightening
the bolts holding the wires and looking
over every truss and brace for possible fracture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hello there, Morey—I thought we had lost
you, I’ve been looking for you. Why didn’t
you come and see the President?”</p>

<p>It was Lieutenant Purcell, looking spick and
span in his full dress uniform.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know it was so late,” answered
Morey. “But I’ve had a fine time.”</p>

<p>“I think we’ll have to make you a member of
the corps,” remarked the officer.</p>

<p>Morey gave a startled look.</p>

<p>“Me?” he exclaimed. “A member of the
Signal Corps?”</p>

<p>“Of course I was joking. But I never saw
any one who seemed to take so naturally to
this as you do.”</p>

<p>Morey had donned his coat and was walking
with the officer toward the barracks. They discussed
generally the exciting events of the day
and then Morey returned to the suggestion made
by his companion.</p>

<p>“What do you mean by joining the corps?”</p>

<p>“I was joking,” explained the Lieutenant.
“Of course you couldn’t. You would have to
enlist as a soldier. I merely thought of it because
we are trying to find a few youngsters
to train in this aeroplane service.”</p>

<p>“Well,” exclaimed Morey promptly—his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
eyes glittering—“why couldn’t I enlist as a
soldier?”</p>

<p>The lieutenant looked at him in surprise.</p>

<p>“In the first place,” he replied with a smile,
“I imagine your mother would not consent or
want you to do it. You are too young.”</p>

<p>“But what if I had her consent?”</p>

<p>“You couldn’t afford to do it. Soldiers don’t
live as you live. You’d have to work.”</p>

<p>Morey was silent a few moments. Then,
reaching the clubhouse, he asked Lieutenant
Purcell if they might not sit down at a table in a
corner of the wide gallery. In the next ten minutes
the boy frankly told the story of his situation.
The officer listened in surprise, but sympathetically.
Nothing was omitted from the
boy’s story.</p>

<p>“I want to dispose of my father’s idea,” Morey
concluded, “and I must make arrangements
to see that my mother is not driven from her
home by the men she thinks are her best friends.
But when those things are accomplished I’ve
got to go to work for a living. I’m no farmer
and was never meant to be one. If, by joining
the army, I can enter the signal corps to study
aviation, I’d like to do it. I <em>mean</em> to do it.”</p>

<p>His friend took his hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>“My boy,” exclaimed Lieutenant Purcell,
“you certainly have a task ahead of you. I can
see that you mean to accomplish it. But, you’ll
need help. I’m going to help you all I can.
We’ll begin this evening. Major Squiers will
be at my home for dinner. We’ll begin with
him so far as your father’s plans are concerned.
You’ll stay with me tonight, and tomorrow I’ll
take you into the city and will talk with some
real estate men I know. Meanwhile, we will
think no more of your enlistment. You don’t
understand what it means.”</p>

<p>“In the signal corps I’d have a chance to be
taught how to handle an aeroplane, wouldn’t
I?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” conceded the lieutenant, “and I think
you would be our star pupil. But the pay—”</p>

<p>“That isn’t it,” interrupted Morey. “I
wouldn’t have to stay in the corps. If I’m a
success I could buy out and then—”</p>

<p>The officer laughed.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think you have enough to bother
about before that comes up?”</p>

<p>“I certainly have,” answered Morey. “But
I’m looking ahead. Anyway, I’m a thousand
times grateful to you. I’d like to meet Major
Squiers and show him what I have. Then I’d<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
better go on into the city and meet you tomorrow,
if you’ll be good enough?”</p>

<p>“You will stay with me tonight. Why not?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got Amos with me,” answered Morey
with a knowing smile.</p>

<p>“We’ll take care of Amos, if he is my
enemy,” laughed the officer.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Purcell was a bachelor, but his
quarters were comfortably furnished. He and
Morey had lingered on the club house veranda
for some time, talking over Colonel Marshall’s
mysterious packet while a corporal went in
quest of Amos and Betty. Soon after the officer
and his guest reached the former’s house the
corporal returned with the report that the horse
and surrey had been found and cared for, but
that the colored boy could not be found. Morey
was alarmed. He proposed an immediate personal
search; but at that moment the telephone
rang.</p>

<p>After talking for some minutes over the telephone
the lieutenant, with much laughing, hung
up the receiver.</p>

<p>“He’s found,” he explained, roaring with
amusement. “He’s in the guard house.”</p>

<p>Morey sprang up in alarm.</p>

<p>“Yes,” went on his host, “but they are going
to bring him here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>“In the guard house?” exclaimed Morey.</p>

<p>“The secret service men arrested him early
this afternoon. He was found prowling about
in the rear of the President’s tent with a rock
tied up in a red handkerchief.”</p>

<p>“Why, that was for you,” explained Morey
nervously, but laughing in spite of himself.
“He’s carried that all the way to Washington
to get even with you for ducking him.”</p>

<p>“That’s what he finally confessed,” roared
Lieutenant Purcell again. “They’ve just had
him before Captain Bryant, the officer of the
day. When he told who he was and who he was
with, Captain Bryant fortunately recalled that
you were my guest—I had been telling him
about you. So, concluding that Amos and I
could settle our own feud, they are bringing him
here to turn him over to us.”</p>

<p>Amos’ armed escort arrived at that moment.
When Morey and his host stepped out on the
piazza two grinning soldiers and a very much
alarmed colored boy stood before them. One of
the guards held in his hand the incriminating
rock, still concealed in its anarchistic covering.
The colored boy burst into tears at sight of Morey
and sank on his knees.</p>

<p>“I ain’t done no hahm, Mr. Soldier. I don’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
mean hahm to no one,” blubbered Amos. “I’s
jes’ lookin’ ’bout.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Purcell took the weighty weapon
and dismissed the soldiers.</p>

<p>“Amos,” he said, as severely as he could,
“what’s the meaning of this rock? Why are
you carrying it with you?”</p>

<p>“Deed, Mr. Soldier, I’s keepin’ dat kaze I’s
’feared o’ robbers.”</p>

<p>“Do you want it again?”</p>

<p>“No, sah, Mr. Soldier, no, sah.”</p>

<p>“They say over at the jail that you said it
was for me; that you wanted to break my head
with it?”</p>

<p>“Me?” whimpered Amos. “No, sah, Mr.
Soldier. Dey’s story-tellers. ’Deed dey is.
Please, Marse Morey,” he wailed, “don’ let
’em bring me to de jail agin. I ain’t mad at no
one, ’bout nothin’. Please, Mr. Soldier!”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Purcell and Morey could no
longer restrain their laughter. Amos was forgiven,
assured that he had already been punished
for his desperate resolve and turned over
to Lieutenant Purcell’s domestics for supper
and lodging.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a><br />
<small>TWO IRONS IN THE FIRE.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>When Major Squiers arrived he greeted Morey
cordially.</p>

<p>“Lieutenant Purcell and Mr. Wright, between
them, have given me a most flattering account
of you, my son. I wish we had a few such
boys in the corps.”</p>

<p>“I’m anxious to enlist,” Morey exclaimed at
once.</p>

<p>This was Lieutenant Purcell’s chance. He
was not slow to express his own views in opposition
to Morey’s desires. But, perhaps to
his surprise, Major Squiers did not agree with
him.</p>

<p>“The science of air navigation,” the elder
officer insisted, “is yet in its infancy. In the
nature of things the army is intensely interested
in the development of both dirigible balloons
and aeroplanes. In some respects I think
the study of this problem is as important as the
solution of new naval problems. As a means
of offense and defense the army is compelled to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
keep abreast if it does not lead in these experiments.
And we mean to do it. But, for the
greatest success, we must have brains. We
must have just the intelligence that this young
man possesses. Naturally, those who are to
assist us, should be under military direction and
control; they should be soldiers. And they
must begin in the ranks. But I know of no department
in the service where promotion is so
sure and certain. Nor do I know of any other
opportunity for a young man to get a technical
education at so little cost to himself. Instead
of dissuading the boy, I think he should be encouraged.”</p>

<p>“There, you see,” exclaimed Morey turning
jubilantly to Lieutenant Purcell, “isn’t that
what I said? Will you enlist me?” he asked
eagerly facing Major Squiers again.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to obtain your parent’s consent.
If you can, I’ll be glad to do so. And I’ll
guarantee to make an aviator out of you in a
mighty short time.”</p>

<p>Until dinner was over nothing was said about
Colonel Marshall’s secret. Lieutenant Purcell
had not yet seen the packet. But, with a few
words of explanation from the younger officer,
Morey produced the precious package from his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
inside coat pocket. The two military experts
immediately adjourned to the library and began
an investigation. Morey was a little surprised
and disappointed that there was no outburst of
astonishment. As they proceeded slowly
through the faded pages, talking to each other
in low tones from time to time, he became nervous.
After all, what if his father’s idea meant
nothing at all? What if their land was worth
no more than Judge Lomax said? Enlisting
in the Signal Corps would not help him out of
his predicament. In fact, it would be a selfish
abandonment of his mother.</p>

<p>When Major Squiers had at last finished the
long manuscript, which Morey himself had not
attempted to read or understand, he lit a cigar
and waited for the younger officer to finish his
examination. Again they spoke together. It
was in a low tone and Morey refrained from
listening. Lieutenant Purcell made a calculation
and shook his head. Morey’s heart sank.</p>

<p>At that, the elder officer motioned to the boy
to approach.</p>

<p>“My son,” he began, “I assume that you are
willing to let me take this matter—I mean these
papers.”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” answered Morey. “I have no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
idea whether they are of value, but if you will
be good enough to look into them, I shall be very
grateful.”</p>

<p>“You are quite sure no one has seen them?”</p>

<p>“Other than my father, no one. I have not
even tried to read them myself.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Purcell glanced at his superior
officer.</p>

<p>“He has an idea that may mean a great
deal,” said Major Squiers. “In carrying out
his theory of turning liquid hydrogen into free
gas again he has also suggested an apparatus
that may solve a difficult problem. We won’t
try to go into it technically, my son, but I want
to show these drawings to the department. Will
you trust them to me?”</p>

<p>Overjoyed, Morey gave ready acquiescence.
Then he exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Do you think I could have his machine patented?”</p>

<p>Major Squiers laughed and shook his head.</p>

<p>“My son,” he explained, “that apparatus is
one of the missing links in the theory of carrying
liquid hydrogen in balloons. The government
of every progressive nation is now searching
for it. If we decide that your father’s plans
are practicable I will undertake to say that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
War Department will buy them outright. But
they will never be patented. It will be an aeronautical
secret to be guarded jealously from the
rest of the world. Are you prepared to sell
them outright?”</p>

<p>Morey sprang up radiant. He took the loose
sheets from the table, put them tremblingly in
order and placed them in Major Squiers’s hands.</p>

<p>“You are to do with them whatever you think
best. I have no suggestions to make, and no
conditions.”</p>

<p>When Major Squiers had gone, Morey, enthusiastic
as a child, laid his arm on Lieutenant
Purcell’s shoulders.</p>

<p>“Lieutenant,” said the boy, “why are you so
good to me?”</p>

<p>The young officer grew suddenly sober, was
silent a moment, and then said:</p>

<p>“Because I can see how hard you are working
to make a good man out of a very foolish
boy.”</p>

<p>That was a new thought for Morey. Hurt by
it at first, he cogitated over it a long time before
going to sleep that night. At last, lying in his
bed, he smiled. “Wasn’t I the limit?” he said
to himself. “Buying a four hundred dollar engine
on a capital of seventy-five cents!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>Lieutenant Purcell’s official duties demanded
his attention until noon the next day. But, after
luncheon, it was arranged that he and Morey
were to go into the city in an electric car and
open up negotiations as to selling his mother’s
land or borrowing money on it. Morey saw at
once that the negotiations under way would be
extended over several days. He had no desire
to force himself upon his new friend’s hospitality
and he had found it impossible to tell his
host that he had but $1.88 in funds. After puzzling
over the matter some time he decided to
take advantage of his unoccupied morning to
dispose of Betty. He would thus be beyond the
necessity of borrowing funds to cover his and
Amos’ expenses for a short time.</p>

<p>Amos had not wandered far from the lieutenant’s
quarters. Fear of the guard house kept
him close to the kitchen. Calling the black boy,
Morey visited the military barn, secured Betty,
gave the enlisted hostler a quarter for his good
nature, and drove out of the reservation.</p>

<p>When Morey turned old Betty’s head to the
west, Amos for the first time showed signs of
life.</p>

<p>“Da’s right, Marse Morey. Le’s go back
home. Dis no place fo’ we all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>“Aren’t you ashamed of yourself, Amos?
It’s a lucky thing they didn’t keep you in jail.”</p>

<p>The black boy shook his head and then as the
reservation was gradually left behind he began
to show boldness.</p>

<p>“Ef dem soldiers did’n have no guns I reckon
I’d show ’em.”</p>

<p>“Look here, you rascal, you were scared to
pieces. Don’t get so brave. We’re going back
again.”</p>

<p>“We gwine back to dat soldier place?”</p>

<p>“We certainly are, and if I hear any more
bragging out of you I’ll tell the soldiers.”</p>

<p>Amos shrank perceptibly.</p>

<p>“Dat soldier man ’sulted me.”</p>

<p>“You’d better forget it,” remarked Morey
curtly. “I’ve had to forget several things in
the past few days.”</p>

<p>As soon as he had passed beyond the more
pretentious country places Morey turned into
a cross road, and at the first thrifty-looking
farmhouse he pulled up. In fifteen minutes the
faithful old Betty had been sold for $30, surrey
thrown in, and Morey and Amos were on their
way back to the fort, toiling and sweating beneath
their bag and bundles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>“How come yo’ did’n leab dese in the barn?”
panted Amos.</p>

<p>“Because,” explained Morey, “since Lieutenant
Purcell has insulted you I thought you
wouldn’t want to sleep and eat in his house. We
are going in to Washington.”</p>

<p>“He did’n ’sult me ’bout eatin’. I had roas’
beef las’ night,” Amos retorted, smacking his
lips. “I ain’t fussin’ ’bout stayin’ dar.”</p>

<p>Morey was in no mood for further discussion.
When he reached the trolley line he boarded a
car and a few minutes later had crossed the
river and was in Georgetown. Keeping a vigilant
lookout he finally discovered, as the car
crossed Jefferson street, in the vicinity of a
river basin and a maze of railroad tracks, a
cheap hotel. As soon as he could stop the car he
made his way back. He could get two rooms at
the rate of fifty cents each a day, without meals.
A bargain was struck and the boys took possession
of adjoining apartments. It was a hotel for
railroad and dock laborers. Neither rooms nor
surroundings were very savory, but they were
reasonably clean.</p>

<p>Amos was in somewhat of a panic when he
learned that he was to be left here until night.</p>

<p>“Whar’ I gwine to eat?” was his first question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>“Amos,” said Morey with a laugh, “you
don’t appreciate your good luck. See that bed?
It has sheets on it. You haven’t had sheets in
years.”</p>

<p>“No, sah. I don’ want ’em. Dey ain’ gwine
keep me wahm.”</p>

<p>“And this apartment is yours. I don’t know
how long we’ll be here. But make yourself at
home.” He took out of his pocket four silver
quarters. “I’ve paid for your room. Down near
the dock you’ll find places to eat—fried fish and
pork and bread and coffee.”</p>

<p>“How much dat gwine cos’ me?” exclaimed
Amos, a grin on his usually somber face.</p>

<p>Morey took up a quarter.</p>

<p>“Never,” he said with a frown, “never, so
long as I am paying your bills, spend more than
two bits for a meal.”</p>

<p>“No, sah,” responded the black boy. “Ah
knows dat—two bits.”</p>

<p>“And now,” said Morey, “you can eat and
sleep until I come back. And don’t get lost.
Be here by six o’clock or I’ll send the police
after you.”</p>

<p>Morey still had time for his toilet. Unpacking
his bag he got out fresh linen and while
Amos brushed his clothes and shoes he took as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
much of a bath as he could get. This done, he
locked their rooms, took Amos to a drug store,
treated the happy black boy to an ice cream
soda, started him back toward the “Basin
House,” their hotel, and then boarded a car for
Fort Meyer.</p>

<p>There was a vigorous protest when he explained
that he had removed Amos and their
baggage to a hotel.</p>

<p>“But how about the horse?” asked Lieutenant
Purcell.</p>

<p>The facts had to come out. Once started,
Morey concealed nothing.</p>

<p>The officer laughed.</p>

<p>“Morey,” he exclaimed, “you’ll certainly win
out. I don’t blame you. You were more than
welcome here, but I suppose I would feel the
same way that you do. However, if you run
out of funds before something turns up, remember
this—I accepted your hospitality as to
the trout stream.”</p>

<p>Morey laughed in turn.</p>

<p>“That was in my foolish days. We didn’t
own any more of that trout creek than you did.”</p>

<p>Within an hour after luncheon the officer and
Morey were in the city and in a well-known real
estate and loan office. A clerk passed them on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
to Lieutenant Purcell’s friend, who gave Morey’s
long story his personal attention. The
manager began shaking his head at once. But,
when Morey mentioned Major Carey and the
Barber Bank, he took a new attitude. Turning
to his desk he looked in an index and then, excusing
himself, went into the outer office and
after some minutes returned with several documents.</p>

<p>“Do you know the Hargrave farm of one hundred
and twenty acres,” he asked, calling Morey
over to his desk.</p>

<p>“I don’t know how many acres he had,” answered
Morey, “but Mr. Hargrave used to
live next to our corn land. Don’t any one live
there now?”</p>

<p>The manager turned to Lieutenant Purcell.</p>

<p>“The old Richmond Trust Company made a
good many peculiar loans out there in Rappahannock
County. It loaned this man Appleton,
who had a tobacco piece, five thousand dollars
on one hundred and twenty acres. It sold the
mortgage to a client of ours and he had to foreclose.
I thought I recalled the transaction when
your friend mentioned the Barber Bank and
this man Carey. Carey bought the land less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
than a year ago and paid forty dollars an acre
for it.”</p>

<p>These business details confused Morey.</p>

<p>“Looks as if Major Carey was out for something
soft,” commented Lieutenant Purcell.</p>

<p>“Our land’s worth as much as the Appleton
place,” exclaimed Morey, who had grasped that
much of the situation.</p>

<p>“Leave me your address,” suggested the
manager. “I’ll send a man out there on a quiet
investigation. These country banks are great
boosters—for themselves. You’ll hear from me
in a few days. It isn’t improbable that I can
be of help to you.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</a><br />
<small>THE SIGNAL CORPS CAMP IN THE MOUNTAINS.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Before leaving the center of the city Lieutenant
Purcell directed Morey to several cheap
but sufficiently good restaurants. Then the two
friends spent several hours in sight-seeing, and
when they separated, Morey went directly to
his room to write to his mother at last. The
letter, although a long one, told only a part of
Morey’s story. As yet he made no mention of
the money they owed Major Carey. It was an
affectionate but positive letter leaving no doubt
as to Morey’s intentions. This letter led up
to a second and more important one.</p>

<p>The following day, having journeyed out to
Fort Meyer and secured the proper form, Morey
wrote again to his mother. In this letter he
asked her consent to his joining the Signal
Corps. This communication was most adroitly
worded. There was in it no reference to the
army, and the average person who read it
would imagine that the “U. S. Signal Corps”
was a sort of technical school, entrance into
which was secured only by a favored few.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>Morey waited four days for his mother’s reply.
During that time he heard nothing from
Major Squiers or from the real estate firm, and
his expenses were already nearly twelve dollars.
Then he called at the real estate office. The
manager remembered him, was profuse in his
apologies, but had been too busy to give the
matter consideration. He would attempt to do
so at once. Morey retired somewhat crestfallen.
He had imagined that his business was to receive
immediate attention. Not wishing to
bother Lieutenant Purcell he went alone to the
War Department and asked to see Major
Squiers. After much delay he was admitted.</p>

<p>Major Squiers greeted him cordially but with
every sign of having no time to lose.</p>

<p>“I just wanted to ask you about the papers?”
Morey explained at once.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” responded the military executive.
“They have been submitted to the proper officials.
When reports are made on them I will
take the matter up with the Secretary of War.
You mustn’t be impatient, my son. We are all
the victims of red tape here in Washington.”</p>

<p>“Have you any idea when I shall know?”</p>

<p>“Not the slightest—weeks perhaps; maybe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
months. You had better go home in the meantime.”</p>

<p>“I should say not,” responded Morey decisively.
“Don’t you remember what you told
me I could do? I can’t afford to loaf, either
here or at home. I want to enlist.”</p>

<p>“I remember,” laughed Major Squiers.
“Have you your mother’s formal consent?”</p>

<p>“I expect to have it in a day or so.”</p>

<p>Major Squiers thought a moment. Then he
turned to his desk and wrote a note.</p>

<p>“Why not?” he asked as he turned around
and handed the envelope to Morey. “Here is a
note to Lieutenant Purcell with a suggestion.
If you are in the service I can the more easily
keep track of you. The lieutenant is leaving in
a few days for the experiment station. I have
suggested that if your mother’s consent arrives
in time and you are formally enrolled before he
leaves, he should take you with him.”</p>

<p>“Where is the experiment station,” asked
Morey, boyishly.</p>

<p>The officer smiled.</p>

<p>“That is a military secret, my son.”</p>

<p>Then Morey smiled.</p>

<p>After expressing his gratitude Morey withdrew.
It pleased him to think that he knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
where the experiment station was. The presence
of Lieutenant Purcell at Linden, only
twenty miles from his home was explained. If
things worked out all right, Morey figured he
would be on his way there in a few days. There,
with the possible chance of seeing his mother
occasionally, he would study the operation of
aeroplanes and would wait for some word as
to his business affairs.</p>

<p>The next morning his mother’s letter came.
It was a pathetic composition, protesting, appealing
and reproaching. And, although she
ordered Morey to return home at once she also
gave her consent that he might join the Signal
Corps. The letter contained also a message
from Amos’ father. The substance of this was
that a “hiding” awaited the colored boy.</p>

<p>Within an hour Morey had consulted with
Lieutenant Purcell. Then he made another call
at the real estate office. The manager, Morey
thought, showed uncalled for impatience. It
had not yet been convenient, it seemed, to look
into the Marshall matter. The disappointed
lad was glad to make his escape. But he left
his new address: “Care Lieut. Fred Purcell, U.
S. Signal Corps.”</p>

<p>By noon he and Amos had packed up their belongings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
eaten luncheon at one of Amos’ favorite
places down near the “Basin,” and the
adventurers were off for Fort Meyer. Morey
was about to become a soldier. Amos following
blindly in Morey’s footsteps, supposed with
his own peculiar logic that the white boy’s enlistment
included him. In the delusion that he,
too, was about to become a soldier and don a
cap and blue clothes he was happy.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Purcell had orders to return to
Linden, or Green Springs, the real location of
the encampment, at noon of the following day.
And at his suggestion Morey was not formally
enlisted until the next morning. All embarrassment
as to Amos was soon relieved. Morey
had money enough to send the black boy home
by train. The officer, however, offered to attach
Amos to himself as a personal servant.</p>

<p>“But he thinks he is to be a soldier,” said
Morey.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” suggested the lieutenant,
“I’ll scare up an old uniform and we’ll rig him
out in it. It will satisfy him and do no one
any harm.”</p>

<p>This was done that evening. When the reservation
ambulance started for Washington and
the train at noon the next day, among the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
corps privates to be transferred to Green
Springs under Sergeant Burns, was Morey, in
a stiff new uniform, and with a soldier’s kit.
Lieutenant Purcell preceded the detachment in
a ’bus and Amos went with him—in reality as
the lieutenant’s personal servant, but so far as
the black boy knew, as much of a soldier as any
in the squad. Three hours later, to Amos’ consternation,
the party alighted in the village of
Linden. The camp wagon was waiting and long
before night Lieutenant Purcell and his men
were at Green Springs.</p>

<p>Morey was assigned to a tent with three other
privates, and Amos—protesting but finally
obeying Morey’s orders—was located in Lieutenant
Purcell’s cook tent with another darkey.
Amos had expected to shoulder a gun, and had
visions of at once stealing away to exhibit himself
in Lee’s Court House. But he found the
duty of waiting on Lieutenant Purcell’s table
more pressing.</p>

<p>Even a quick examination satisfied Morey
that he had made no mistake. The camp and
its surroundings seemed a fairy land to him.
High up on the slope of the Blue Mountains,
well concealed behind a barrier of mountain ash
trees, lay a plateau. This plateau led into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
broad rift in the mountain. Deep in this valley,
next the spring that gave the place its name,
was the camp. A score of tents surrounding a
square, housed the soldiers and officers selected
by the War Department to be trained in the use
of the aeroplane. Just below the camp and
fronting a slope leading to the plateau outside
were two large tents. In one of these were two
aeroplanes—Wright machines—and in the other
was a shop and quarters for two civilian representatives
of the airship manufacturers.</p>

<p>Fascinated by the surroundings and the daily
routine of the work Morey threw himself enthusiastically
into the experiments. He was
young, full of ideas and more than willing. He
was assigned to the shop division and in three
weeks he was as well informed on the theory and
construction of an aeroplane as the experts
themselves. So intent was he upon his duties
that he seemed to have no thought for any thing
else. But no day went by in which he did not
inquire of his superior officer whether any message
had come for him from Major Squiers or
the real estate firm. But his frequent and keen
disappointment in this hope always passed
away in the fervor with which he executed his
tasks. The men were not allowed to send messages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
from the camp. Nor were they permitted
to visit Linden unless accompanied by an officer.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Purcell had tried several men in
short flights, always making longer ones himself,
generally about sundown. Morey now had
his first experience in the machine. Corporal
Appleton was the favored pupil. One evening
early in July, Lieutenant Purcell and Corporal
Appleton were preparing for a trial flight. The
car was on the track, the lieutenant was in place
at the levers and the corporal was just mounting
alongside his superior when the latter looked
up, sprang from the car and ordered Appleton
away and into custody. The soldier was partly
intoxicated.</p>

<p>Without a spoken word Lieutenant Purcell
turned toward Morey and nodded his head. In
another moment the young Virginian was by the
officer’s side, the aeroplane had been released
and the craft was swirling forward and upward.
Almost before Morey could catch his breath the
world seemed dropping from beneath him.
There was a long, slanting curve and Morey’s
heart almost stopped beating. He closed his
eyes and gripped the fragile frame. A cold
sweat covered his body. Again the car swayed.
The boy, almost dizzy with fear, gasped and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
bit his lips. The whirr of the propellers filled
the air. Then, suddenly, came the sense of
smoothness, the absence of vibration, the feeling
that without jar or quiver the delicate vehicle
was floating.</p>

<p>At last Morey opened his eyes. He closed
them quickly. So far beneath them that the
sense of height was almost sickening, the plain
and forest were rushing by with the speed of
an express. But he began to reason. He had
at last achieved a step in his ambition. With
all the grit he had he pulled himself together.
Again he opened his eyes—this time to keep
them open. His companion was not afraid.
Why should he be?</p>

<p>“How is she doing?” he exclaimed suddenly,
surprised at his own calmness.</p>

<p>“Beautifully. Watch me!”</p>

<p>And the boy did. Far out over the forest in
the gathering twilight the aeroplane flew like a
disc. Then the aviator turned to the south. At
this long swoop the sickening depression came
again into Morey’s breast, but only for a moment.</p>

<p>“It’s this or nothing, for me,” he said to
himself and with a last effort he put aside his
fear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>“Look ahead,” exclaimed Lieutenant Purcell
suddenly. “See something white?”</p>

<p>“Looks like a building.”</p>

<p>“Top of the courthouse in your village.”</p>

<p>Five miles toward the village the aeroplane
flew and then Lieutenant Purcell turned once
more. Just at dusk the airship sank gently to
the earth in front of the camp. Amos grabbed
Morey as a mother might clasp a lost child. He
was blubbering and breathless. The black boy
had chased the aeroplane and was almost exhausted.</p>

<p>“Marse Morey,” he panted, “ef yo’ all ebber
go in that hurricane agin I’s gwine right home
and tell yo’ ma.”</p>

<p>Morey had another opportunity the next day.
Appleton was in disgrace. Morey was given
his place and in the evening, after another short
flight with Lieutenant Purcell, he was allowed to
make a trial flight alone near the ground. In
the week that followed Morey made daily
flights—at last over the adjacent forest. His
skill and confidence grew with every ascent.
Lieutenant Purcell was not disappointed in his
pupil. He had already assured the boy of a
promotion to a sergeancy. Morey’s proud
satisfaction had only one cloud on it—still no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
word came from Washington concerning his
business negotiations.</p>

<p>On the morning of July 13, Morey was summoned
to headquarters. Lieutenant Purcell
greeted him with a sober face.</p>

<p>“Morey,” he said at once, “I have a disagreeable
duty to perform. You will remember
that it was not on my advice that you joined
the Corps. Yet, I have done all I could to teach
you what we know. In my judgment you have
been too apt a pupil. Major Squiers has just
made a requisition on me for my best operator.
You are not only my best, but you are practically
the only one I can trust.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad to hear that,” said the boy. “But
what makes your duty disagreeable?”</p>

<p>“Because I must conscientiously recommend
you to Major Squiers.”</p>

<p>Morey’s eyes opened in surprise.</p>

<p>“Isn’t that a compliment?”</p>

<p>“It is a dangerous job. They are going to
begin experimenting with explosives and their
effects when dropped from aeroplanes.”</p>

<p>“Good!” exclaimed Morey. “Do you mean
that I’m to have a chance at this?”</p>

<p>“I must submit your name. But it is exceedingly
hazardous work. You can take or refuse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
the offer. Appleton is ready to go if you don’t.”</p>

<p>“When do I start?” was the boy’s only answer.</p>

<p>“Whoever I send must be in Arlington, New
Jersey, tomorrow. You’ll have to start on the
slow train this evening and leave Washington
on the six o’clock express in the morning.”</p>

<p>As Morey grasped his lieutenant’s hand in
both of his he said:</p>

<p>“Lieutenant, you’re a brick. You’ve certainly
done your share in trying to turn a foolish
boy into a good man.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</a><br />
<small>THE AEROPLANE AS A WAR MACHINE.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The government had selected an old colonial
home, sequestered in a bit of forest a few miles
south of Arlington, as a base for its practical
aeroplane experiments. It had selected this
place for two important reasons. The house,
now almost in ruins, was on a ridge just beyond
the tidal flats or salt marshes west of New
York, and it fronted on what had been a plaza.
This made an admirable starting ground and
from it there was an uninterrupted but distant
view of the sea. From this leafy retreat, well
off the main road and only approached over a
now weed-grown lane, closely guarded, the airships
could emerge in the early dawn or at twilight,
sail over the untenanted marshes and return,
practically without being observed.</p>

<p>The house, which had an old-fashioned, glassless
octagonal observatory on top, was further
screened from discovery by a new fence. On
the building itself there had been but few repairs
made. Major Squiers and Lieutenant
Purcell, when they were there, occupied adjoining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
rooms on the first floor. No attempt had
been made to furnish these. The officers practically
“camped out” in the big, bare rooms.
On the second floor were a dozen or more soldiers,
including three sergeants and a corporal.
The two men who assisted Mr. Wright at Fort
Meyer were also here. In the yard in the rear
was a cook tent. The men ate in another tent
beneath the trees.</p>

<p>Beyond the tents, and approached by a path
running through denser trees and a wilderness
of weedy vegetation, was the plaza, or outlook,
on which the long since dead owner had been
accustomed to sniff the ocean breezes and from
which, far across the marshy meadows the ocean
might be seen.</p>

<p>Into this interesting place Morey was conducted
by Corporal Steele early in the day. Major
Squiers was there and in charge. Lieutenant
Purcell was expected in three or four days.
The boy was turned over at once to Sergeant
McLean, who took him to the commander’s
apartment.</p>

<p>“Since you are now all here,” said Major
Squiers, turning to the sergeant, after a few
moment’s talk with Morey, “you may as well
draw lots for the order in which you are to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
called. We may make a flight at any time.
Some officials from Washington will arrive tomorrow
or the day after. When they do, we
must be ready to begin work at once.”</p>

<p>These flights were for the purpose of navigating,
if possible, an aeroplane from the Arlington
ridge, across the marshes, over Staten
Island and then dropping explosives on a target
in the Lower Bay, south of Staten Island. This
target was a condemned man-of-war, which for
several weeks had been mysteriously anchored
off the shore. In order not to attract undue
attention the vessel was manned. But officers
and men were prepared to abandon the hulk at
any time on signal.</p>

<p>The aeroplane shed was a canvas house on
the garden plaza. By its side was a shop. The
aeroplane tested at Fort Meyer was installed
here with a second one on the ground in crates.
This one had just arrived. The plans of the
War Department were twofold. Not only were
various explosives to be tested by being dropped
from a swiftly flying car, but some of the actual
conditions of war were to be present. It was
especially desired to make the experiment cover
some ground. The distance from the Arlington
ridge to the Lower Bay was nearly twenty miles.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
It was believed that if this distance could be
covered by a machine without descending and a
safe return accomplished, that some of the exigencies
of actual warfare would have been
met.</p>

<p>Morey was sent to the upper floor to install
himself. While he was picking out a cot he
was recalled to the commander’s apartment. A
drawing of lots was to take place to decide the
order in which the four available operators
would be called on to serve.</p>

<p>“First,” explained Major Squiers, “although
you are all soldiers, not one of whom would
shirk his duty, the department wants to make
this fact plain. This work is so new and so
hazardous that it is to be the policy of the Secretary
of War to call for volunteers in aeroplaning.
In actual warfare it is not impossible
that weapons of defense will be at once devised
that will make the work of an aeroplane
almost a deliberate sacrifice of life. If any one
of you wishes to wait until the science we are
developing is more advanced and aviation of
this sort is attended with less danger, do not
be ashamed to say so. It will not be charged
against you.”</p>

<p>Four men smiled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>“As I anticipated,” said Major Squiers,
smiling in turn. “All of you are eager Hobsons.”</p>

<p>As a result of the drawing the order was:</p>

<p>1st. Corporal D. M. Steele, 26 years old,
Omaha, Nebraska (the dirigible experimental
station).</p>

<p>2nd. Private Mortimer Marshall, 18 years
old, Green Springs’ testing grounds.</p>

<p>3rd. Sergeant S. A. McLean, 37 years old,
Fort Meyer.</p>

<p>4th. P. S. Bloom, 29 years old, Fort Meyer.</p>

<p>As the men filed out of the room Major
Squiers detained Morey a moment.</p>

<p>“I’m rather glad, my son, you were not first.”</p>

<p>“But, I’m second,” proudly replied the boy.
“I’ll show you that Lieutenant Purcell is a good
teacher.”</p>

<p>“By the way,” added his superior, “don’t
believe that your father’s project has been buried.
It has reached the engineering department.
Unofficially I hear that it has made a
sensation. That is, it has started a hot dispute.
That looks good, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t look as good to me as this,” said
Morey, holding up his little square of cardboard
numbered ‘2.’ “I hope it is of use and is worth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
something, but I wouldn’t trade my chance here
for all the money it may bring.”</p>

<p>“How is that?” inquired Major Squiers, puzzled.</p>

<p>“Because I want to do something myself.”</p>

<p>“When your chance comes I’m sure you
will,” said the elder man very kindly, and he
patted the boy on the head.</p>

<p>Before the first flight was made Lieutenant
Purcell arrived—three days later—and the next
day a sudden message came that the official
board was on the proving ground on the south
shore of Staten Island. There was hurry and
anxiety but no commotion in the distant New
Jersey station. At six in the afternoon Corporal
Steele, bareheaded and in his shirt
sleeves, made a short experimental flight. Major
Squiers had left the camp at four o’clock to
board a waiting tug at Jersey City. At twenty
minutes past six, after a safe return to the
plaza, where he took on two cordite bombs
weighing thirty pounds each, the eager aviator
was off like a bird over the Jersey flats. At half
past six he had disappeared in the smoke wafting
southward from Jersey City.</p>

<p>Just after seven o’clock Lieutenant Purcell
received this message by telephone:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>“Steele’s flight was admirable but he failed
in his drop. Both bombs delivered at once and
too soon. They struck the water and disappeared
without exploding. If he returns successfully
and there is time before dark, make
a second trial. Attempt nothing after dark.
Take no chances with shipping in the bay.”</p>

<p>Corporal Steele was on the starting plateau
at a quarter past seven. The operator was
chagrined, but not discouraged. His control of
the machine had been perfect. He at once insisted
that there should be an automatic device
for releasing the explosive independently of the
operator’s hands. But, in the midst of his explanation,
Lieutenant Purcell turned to Morey.
There was at least three quarters of an hour
of twilight remaining. The aeroplane was
turned, two new bombs were hastily brought
and Morey got into the seat.</p>

<p>His great chance had come at last. Calmly
and distinctly he gave the word and the car was
hurled into the still evening air. Taking advantage
of his start Morey held his forward or
horizontal rudder skyward and allowed the
obedient aeroplane to mount upward as it flew
through the almost breezeless air. Up and up
he soared until the grey marsh beneath was only
a haze. A thousand feet above the tidewater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
swamp the young aviator brought himself to a
horizontal course. Before and beyond him he
could make out the horizon-bounded sea. In a
few moments the outlines of Staten Island became
clear in the dusk and then the unmistakable
grey target rose out of the water beyond.</p>

<p>The two bombs had been suspended in little
net hammocks on each side of the aviator. On
each was a wire handle. Morey reached into
his pocket and took out his new knife. Opening
the largest blade he placed the knife between his
teeth. Then carefully, while some distance from
the target vessel, he drew the other bomb from
its hammock and placed it in his lap. He was
ready.</p>

<p>A thousand yards from the anchored marsh
he settled himself and judged his distance. He
was counting on some breeze at sea. He could
feel it gently wafting landward from the northeast.
His experience at Green Springs had
taught him every movement of the machine. As
he drew nearer to the vessel he bore off into the
breeze as if to pass to one side of the target.
He seemed about to sail by it on the north when
with a quick shift of his vertical rudders he
turned. The aeroplane trembled, seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
catch itself for a moment and then, with a long,
graceful curve it headed for the vessel and
darted downward like a bird.</p>

<p>There was another rapid movement of the
horizontal rudders and the darting fall was
checked. The airship wavered as if to gather
itself for a new flight. The swiftly beating
propellers sent the air against the planes and
the machine began to rise once more. There
was an instant’s pause. The boy’s hand shot
forward to cut away the hanging bomb with the
keen blade. At the same instant Morey’s knees
opened and the deadly package in his lap slid
between his legs. Almost at the same moment
the two bombs crashed upon the steel deck and
the aeroplane had darted on.</p>

<p>There was a roar, a flash of fire far beneath,
and Morey knew that he had made the first successful
experiment with the aeroplane as a war
machine; he had won “in the clouds for Uncle
Sam.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII</a><br />
<small>SERGEANT MARSHALL OUTWITS MAJOR CAREY.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The maneuvers continued with daily flights.
In a short time Morey was, by common consent,
conceded to be the foremost in the work. He
held the record for the most exact work in the
handling of explosives and had flown the highest.
Sergeant McLean made the longest continuous
flight—the length of Long Island and
return.</p>

<p>The promised promotion to a sergeancy came
at the end of the first week of experimenting.
In his new stripes the boy had visible proof that
the “foolish boy” had really made progress in
his effort to accomplish something. Then, one
morning came a shock. He received a letter
from his mother.</p>

<p>No sooner had Lieutenant Purcell left the
Green Spring’s camp than Amos disappeared.
As he was not a soldier, little attention was
given his departure. Reaching Aspley Place
after a footsore tramp, the black boy was received
with open arms. Even his father, old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
Marsh Green, agreed to refrain from administering
the “hiding” he had promised. As
Amos related to Morey’s mother the wonders he
had seen and the exploits of the yet missing
white boy his imagination ran riot. Old Don
Quixote never shone with the glamor of romance
that the black boy created for Morey.
Mrs. Marshall was in despair. And other
things had now arisen that made her son’s absence
doubly trying.</p>

<p>Amos had no idea where Morey had gone.
But Mrs. Marshall’s letter of appeal to her son
was forwarded to Green Springs in care of
Lieutenant Purcell and from that place it was
forwarded to the station at Arlington. When
Morey read it he was in despair.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“My dear Morey,” it ran. “How can I say
what your absence has been to me! Amos has
told us all. I am heartbroken that you did not
return with him. I thought you were in school
at Washington. He tells me you are a soldier.
Twice I have written to you in Washington
and each time my letter has come back. You
must come to me at once. Mr. Bradner has told
me all. I cannot understand it, but he says
we must give up our home; that Major Carey
and Captain Barber are arranging to get for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
us a new home in the village. This cannot be
necessary, but he says I must. It is something
about money that your father owed. Now they
say we can no longer live on Aspley Place. Major
Carey has been to see me. He says it is
true; that some one in Richmond insists on having
money that I cannot pay. He has selected
a little cottage where we must live—but I cannot
write of it. Won’t you come home and help
me?”</p>
</div>

<p>The glory of his success in the corps seemed
very small to Morey then. When he thought
over what had happened in the last few weeks
he could only reproach himself with the thought
that he had deserted his mother. He at once
sought out Major Squiers. To him he told his
story.</p>

<p>“May I go home for a few days?” he pleaded.
“I know now that I did wrong to enlist. But
I’ve got to go home and see what I can do.”</p>

<p>“I’ll give you leave of absence for a week,”
answered his superior sympathetically. “If, at
the end of that time you want more leave let me
know and I’ll grant it. But you did not do
wrong. You are going to be a credit to yourself
and to your mother.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to Washington,” said Morey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
tremulously. “If nothing can be done there I’ll
go home. With what I know I’ll confront the
men who are trying to rob us. I’m sure I’m
enough older now to accomplish something.”</p>

<p>“You must,” replied Major Squiers, “for I
have counted on you in my summer plans. You
have become valuable to us. Arrange to rejoin
the corps by the first of August—you cannot
afford to miss what I have arranged for you.”</p>

<p>At three o’clock that afternoon the disconsolate
boy was in Washington on his way home
on a leave of absence. Hastening to the office of
the real estate firm he met the manager just
leaving for the day.</p>

<p>“I meant to write to you in the morning,”
began the busy dealer with unusual condescension.
“I have a proposition to make to you
and your mother. Jump in my car! I’m going
out for a little ride. We’ll talk it over in the
automobile.”</p>

<p>Morey’s heart leaped.</p>

<p>“I’ll be perfectly frank with you,” said the
manager, “and what I have to say is based on
the assumption that you represent your
mother.”</p>

<p>“I think you can do that, sir,” replied Morey.
“She has not authorized me to act for her, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
our necessities are such that I must compel
her to listen to reason.”</p>

<p>“Well,” began the agent, “we have had a
man in your part of the country and he has just
returned. It was not difficult to find that the
Barber Bank is preparing to secure your land.
We are like the Barber Bank, in a way. We are
here to make money where and when we can.
The land is ample security for the loan you
ask.”</p>

<p>“And you’ll let me have it?” exclaimed Morey.</p>

<p>The manager shook his head.</p>

<p>The lad’s heart sank.</p>

<p>“What we will do is this: Major Carey
wants your land, that is plain. I think, too,
he’ll pay forty dollars an acre for it when he
sees he has to. My proposition is this: we’ll
take up your notes—your father’s and your
mother’s—and, if your mother will make such a
contract, carry them until we can sell the property.
As our profit we will take one-half the
selling price over the amount we invest. That
will be something over $14,000. If we sell the
farm of six hundred acres at forty dollars there
will be a balance of $10,000 over what we put in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
the deal. That will mean $5,000 for your mother
and $5,000 for us.”</p>

<p>Morey finally understood, then he too shook
his head.</p>

<p>“I can’t,” he said. “I reckon your offer is
fair enough but I can’t let the home farm go.
That’s what I’m working for. There are one
hundred and sixty acres around our home that
I want to keep—that I must save. You know
the place. There are four hundred and forty
acres besides this. If you’ll pay those notes
I’ll undertake to see that my mother gives you
a deed to all this.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see that it makes much difference,”
said the manager.</p>

<p>“It makes all the difference in the world to
me. It won’t give us any money but it will give
us a home. And I’ll make a living somehow.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do it. Your friends in the Barber Bank
are sharks. I like to take a fall out of those
country wise ones occasionally.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Tuttle,” said Morey, after a few moments,
“that’s business and no favor on either
side. I’m going to ask a personal favor. I’m
too young to ask it legally but on what you know
of me will you lend me $100.”</p>

<p>The manager smiled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>“Our investment company would not think
of such a thing. But we are not in the office
just now. Your note wouldn’t be good, but your
face is.” He reached in his pocket, took out a
wallet, counted out five twenty-dollar bills and
then laid on them his personal card, J. D.
Tuttle. “When you can do so, send it to me.
Haven’t you any funds?”</p>

<p>“Enough to get home,” responded Morey,
“but I’m going to pay a fine with part of that
and keep out of jail.”</p>

<p>“A fine? For what?”</p>

<p>“I bumped old Judge Lomax, in our town,
on the floor because he said our place wasn’t
worth twenty dollars an acre.”</p>

<p>“Whew!” laughed the manager. “I’m glad I
valued it higher.”</p>

<p>Arrangements were soon concluded. When
Morey left for Lee’s Court House in the morning
an agent of the investment company was
with him. They reached the little Rappahannock
County town at about eleven o’clock. One of
Marshal Robertson’s self-imposed duties was to
conscientiously attend the arrival of each train.
The marshal was dutifully on the platform.</p>

<p>“Do you want me?” asked Morey, hurrying
up to the guardian of the peace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>The boy’s natty uniform, his new cap and his
sergeant’s stripes seemed to overpower the
town official.</p>

<p>“Fur poundin’ up Jedge Lomax?” he stammered
at last.</p>

<p>“You can call it that,” laughed Morey, “although
I didn’t.”</p>

<p>“Fur land’s sakes, Morey, where ha’ ye
abeen? That’s all settled long ago. I reckon
your mother must a’ got Major Carey to see
Jedge Lomax. Anyhow the warrant is withdrew.”</p>

<p>That was what had happened. As soon as
Mrs. Marshall had heard of the difficulty she
had hurried to her friends, Captain Barber and
Major Carey. Through them the disgruntled
Lomax—who never had been near to dying—had
been unable to resist feminine appeals, particularly
when Major Carey added his request to
that of Morey’s mother.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Morey with decision, “I think
that is a good thing—for Judge Lomax. I was
just about to swear out a warrant for his arrest.
I’ll wait now until I hear more from him.”</p>

<p>The investment company’s representative
was a young lawyer. Morey’s mother had no
telephone in her house. So within a few minutes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
the town livery man had two horses hitched to
an ancient hack and by noon Morey and the
agent were at Aspley Place.</p>

<p>For half an hour Morey was alone with his
mother in her bedroom. In the end she was
reconciled. Morey did not attempt to make her
realize all that he had come to know.</p>

<p>“I’ll never believe it of Major Carey,” she
kept repeating.</p>

<p>“That’s all right, mater,” Morey answered
at last. “Think as you like. But I’m a man
now. All you have to do is to sign the contract.
I’ll see that you keep Aspley Place. And, if I
have good luck, I’ll see that we make our own
butter again.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid it isn’t what your father would
have liked.”</p>

<p>“Father lived when things were different.
Everything has changed. I’m changed.”</p>

<p>By mid-afternoon Morey and the agent were
in Major Carey’s office. The news of Morey’s
return had spread quickly. The dignified
planter-banker was not at his ease. He began
the interview by mildly censuring the boy for
his sudden leave-taking. Then he seemed to
desire to mend matters a little by explaining
how he had adjusted the trouble with Judge Lomax.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
Morey heard him impatiently and then
came to the point.</p>

<p>“I suppose you remember what I said to
you the last time I saw you?” began Morey.</p>

<p>“You were not wholly in command of yourself,”
replied Major Carey, condescendingly.</p>

<p>“I told you when I entered your office again
that I’d be here to settle with you. I’m ready.”</p>

<p>“To settle with me?”</p>

<p>“With you, Captain Barber, Mr. Bradner,
the bank, or any one else that has a claim
against my mother.”</p>

<p>“Morey, what does this mean?”</p>

<p>“It means that you folks think you own this
town and all the people in it. You do, too,
pretty much—except us. Produce your statement
of every cent we owe you. I want the
notes and have the money to square up.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Betts,” said Major Carey, nervously,
“does this boy know what he is talking about?”</p>

<p>“Looks like it?” laughed the young lawyer,
taking a blue envelope from his pocket in which
the Virginian could not fail to note an ample
supply of currency. “We were afraid the Barber
Bank might not like the looks of our check.”</p>

<p>Major Carey, red in the face and thick of
speech, sprang to his feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>“This is a bluff,” he exclaimed. “What are
you trying to do?”</p>

<p>“Not trying,” said Morey in turn, and himself
white about the mouth. “I’m just taking
up my mother’s obligations. Then her farm will
be clear and free from debt.”</p>

<p>The planter sank back in his chair.</p>

<p>“You should have talked to me about this,
Morey. I’d have bought that land from you.”</p>

<p>“You can get it yet,” smiled Morey. “It’ll
be on the market in a few days. The price is
fifty dollars an acre, cash.”</p>

<p>Major Carey was upset. He retired to the
bank below and returned in a few moments with
Mr. Bradner, his son-in-law. But the latter was
equally disturbed. There was nothing to do
but produce the notes and prepare a statement.
The moment this was ready Morey interrupted
the proceedings again.</p>

<p>“Are you ready to make your settlement for
the rent of the corn land, Major Carey?”</p>

<p>This was a bombshell. There were futile
and foolish arguments about “favor to Mrs.
Marshall to prevent the place going to weeds,”
“high taxes,” “fence repairs,” and “poor
crops.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>“Take ’em all out,” retorted Morey, sharply.
“I only want what is ours.”</p>

<p>Major Carey had to beg for time until morning
to consult his receipts and farm books. Another
meeting was arranged for the next day at
ten o’clock.</p>

<p>At that time, taking his own unquestioned
figures and allowing him half the crops for two
years—deducting forty acres of waste land and
an array of expenses that made Mr. Betts smile,
Major Carey was compelled to concede that
there was a surplus of $4,160 to be divided.</p>

<p>Morey’s pencil was out.</p>

<p>“We owe you,” he said sharply, “$14,092.50.
You owe us $2,080. The difference is $12,012.50.
Here’s your money.”</p>

<p>The disconcerted planter sat for a spell as if
in a trance.</p>

<p>“How about this year’s corn crop?” he murmured
at last.</p>

<p>“I am now interested in this property Major
Carey,” explained the agent. “Since you have
put in a crop without even the formality of
renting the ground you will certainly lose it.”</p>

<p>By night the transaction was closed and Mr.
Betts left on the evening train. He had turned
over $2,080, the corn land rental to Mrs. Marshall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
and Morey had taken from it a hundred
dollars to be paid to Mr. Tuttle in Washington.</p>

<p>The next day Morey entered the Barber Bank
and deposited his mother’s rental money to her
account. Captain Barber treated him with a
cold dignity. Almost out of the door the boy
turned:</p>

<p>“By the way, Captain Barber. Our land is
on the market. If you know any one who wants
it they can have it at a bargain, $50 an acre.”</p>

<p>With his mother’s home and one hundred and
sixty acres clear of debt, $2,000 in the bank and
the possibility of perhaps $3,000 more from the
sale of the rest of the farm, Morey at once prepared
to return to the Signal Corps. It was almost
against his mother’s command, but she
finally reluctantly consented. The day before
his leave expired he drove their new horse and
buggy to Lee’s Court House to secure a man to
help Marsh Green in needed work on the place.
Amos was with him.</p>

<p>“Marse Morey,” exclaimed the black boy,
“dey done say dat yo’ all got plenty money
now.”</p>

<p>Morey, his mind on something else, answered:</p>

<p>“I’ve got my pay as a soldier.”</p>

<p>Amos sighed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ain’ dat nuff to pay me mah money what
yo’ all loan’ from me?”</p>

<p>Morey laughed and then he grew sober. He
had wholly forgotten the one person who had
helped him when he most needed assistance.</p>

<p>“What is a banjo worth, Amos?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Ah kin git one fo’ foah dollahs an’ two bits.”</p>

<p>“Here,” exclaimed the white boy, taking a
treasured twenty dollar bill from his pocket.
“This is for what I borrowed and a banjo and
all the cinnamon drops you can eat.”</p>

<p>As Morey entered the bank a little later on
some business for his mother, he was overtaken
by the station agent and telegraph operator,
who was in a state of high excitement and out of
breath. The man had a carefully sealed telegram
in his hand, but from his face it could be
seen that he knew every word of its contents.
Major Carey had just come downstairs from
his office. He had been making desperate efforts
when he met Morey, to reinstate himself
in the lad’s good graces.</p>

<p>“Official orders, I reckon?” exclaimed the
banker.</p>

<p>Morey read the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="noi">“Sergeant Mortimer Marshall:</p>

<p>“Department reports favorably. Offers $25,000<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>

widow. Congratulations. Report at Fort Meyer

France August eighth to witness French war
office aeroplane trials.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="padr2 smcap">Squiers,</span><br />
“Major U. S. Signal Corps.”</p>
</div>

<p>Morey, excited inwardly, but apparently calm,
handed the message to Major Carey.</p>

<p>“Are you going to get all that money from
the government?” the latter asked.</p>

<p>“My mother is,” smiled Morey proudly. “It
isn’t mine and I don’t want it. I’m satisfied to
be just Sergeant Morey Marshall of the Signal
Corps.”</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
